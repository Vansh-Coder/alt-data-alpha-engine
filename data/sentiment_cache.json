  "Nvidia didn\u2019t just win with tech  it won with customers - Everyone talks about how Nvidia ($NVDA) has the best product  and yeah, H100s and now B100s are beasts. But honestly, what really sets them apart is who\u2019s buying from them. When the top five richest companies on Earth  AMZN, GOOG, META, MSFT, even TSLA  are all basically funneling their AI capex directly into Nvidia\u2019s pockets, you realize this isn\u2019t just about good tech. It\u2019s about having the best seat at the table\n\n$4 trillion market cap. That\u2019s not just hype anymore. It\u2019s the result of every major tech platform building AI data centers on top of Nvidia\u2019s ecosystem. Even if their AI tools flop or adoption slows, Nvidia already got paid. Meanwhile, the Apples, Metas, Googles of the world still need to convince us that the AI tools are worth using\n\nAnd yeah, sure  competition is coming. AMD, Intel, startups like Groq or Cerebras\u2026 But Nvidia\u2019s lead isn\u2019t just in chips. It\u2019s in software (CUDA), developer loyalty, global reach, and sheer momentum\n\nAt this point, they\u2019re not just selling chips. They\u2019re selling shovels during a gold rush  and the miners are billion-dollar tech giants with no choice but to buy in\n\nI\u2019m not saying there\u2019s no risk. If AI turns out to be overhyped, or if capex cools off, Nvidia could feel it. But so far, every quarterly report just reinforces the same message: the AI boom may be messy, but Nvidia wins either way\n\nThey\u2019re making money before anyone else does while everyone\u2019s still figuring out how to monetize AI, Nvidia is just cashing checks": 0.8,
  "Trump Just Dropped The 50% \u2018Copper Tariff Bomb\u2019 - What Does This Mean For The Stock Market? - That's right ...Trump just announced that he will impose a 50% tariff on copper, effective August 1, 2025, citing a \u201cnational security assessment.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, he bombastically emphasized the importance of copper to the country: copper is the second most used material in the Department of Defense. How can we let \u2018sleepy leaders\u2019 destroy this industry? It's time to rebuild America's copper industry. This is our golden age!\n\nWhat this means for the market (personal opinion): Copper prices could be about to spike (again) Copper (HG=F) has bounced around $4.50/lb last week. Once the tariffs hit the ground, expect importers to stock up ahead of time and copper mining stocks to put in a rally. Focus: Freeport-McMoRan ($FCX), Southern Copper ($SCCO), Teck ($TECK), as well as small-caps Taseko ($TGB), Copper Mountain ($CPPMF).\n\nRisk of rising short-term inflationary pressures \n\nCopper is widely used in construction, data centers, electric vehicles, power grids, and defense.\n\n50% tariffs = higher costs = could push up cost transmission effects in industrial and tech supply chains.\n\nNew energy, EV sectors could be under pressure \n\nTesla ($TSLA), Enphase ($ENPH), Azure ($NIO), etc. could face higher raw material costs.\n\nEnergy storage and battery businesses will have their margins squeezed if they haven't hedged copper prices in advance.\n\nDefense contractors may be forced to strain \n\nRTX, LMT, NOC, and others rely on copper for radar, missile, and flight systems.\n\nWith tariffs raising domestic copper prices, these companies may either lobby the government or turn to local supply chains.\n\nMy personal view: \n\nShort term? Bullish on copper mining stocks, bearish on rising manufacturing costs \n\nMedium term? Watch inflation and Fed policy feedback \n\nLong term? This is clearly a big election year move, with lots of policy variables and no shortage of volatility\n\nIncidentally: if copper prices continue to rise, it may be harder for the Fed to cut rates as a result - a potential impact variable for the stock market as a whole.\n\nWould also like to hear your thoughts: \n\nDo you think this is a pre-election bluff? Or will Congress really follow through?\n\nHas anyone started laying out copper futures or options yet?\n\nIs this just short term volatility or the beginning of a major style switch in industrial stocks? Not investment advice. Just a guy who stares at copper futures every day like it's an EKG.": 0.5,

  "NVDA In-Depth Discussion Post: why do AI giants continue to strengthen? Up or down? My view at the end. - Latest data and market performance \n\nAs of today, Nvidia shares are trading at $162.44, with an intraday high of $164.71 (hitting the $4T market cap threshold), a slight intraday pullback, but generally stable, and up over 40% over the past three months, with a cumulative gain of \\~20% since 2025 - a wave largely driven by the AI boom!\n\nAI Demand Rampage: Blackwell Sovereign AI \n\nBlackwell architecture chips (including GB200 datacenter products and RTX 50 series) continue to drive datacenter and high-end gaming markets, with high demand through 2024-25 \n\nSovereign AI \"Wave: Citi raises target price to 190, focusing on strong growth in demand for government-grade AI deployments, AI data center market expected to grow to $563B by 2028\n\nNVDA financial performance: far exceeded expectations \n\nQ1 2025 revenue reached $44.06B, up 69% y/y; of which data center revenue was $39.1B, up 73% y/y. ytd stock price rose 21%, more than triple in 3 years, the market is optimistic about continued expansion in the next 2 years.\n\nPullback pressure and potential risks: export restrictions impact: up to $8B of China sales are restricted, short-term profits and revenue there is a non-negligible disturbance \n\nvaluation height: although a number of institutions still maintain a Strong Buy, the target price is mainly concentrated in the $174-$190 range, the potential upside space is limited.\n\nCompetition and macro uncertainty: AMD, Broadcom and other rivals continue to force, and the global economy, interest rates and policy may become uncertain launch factors.\n\nMy short-term technical outlook and market observation \n\nIf the US market pulls back due to macro risks, NVDA will also be under short-term retracement pressure.\n\nResistance: $164.7-165 range highs are key, breakout could trigger a rally to $175-190. \n\nSupport: $155-160. If broken, be wary of technical corrective pressure.\n\nMy view \n\nLong term holders: \n\nNVDA has AI \u201cNo. 1\u201d status, architecture + chip + software ecosystem is mature, government and enterprise AI continues to expand, valuation is high but the next 3 years there is still a lot of room for growth.\n\nShort-term traders: \n\ncurrent position between resistance and support, high valuation stage, if touch export restrictions or macro negative, or 5-10% retracement opportunities. If it breaks $165, short-term follow-through long can be considered.\n\nConclusion Summary: \n\nSupporting factors: Blackwell chip architecture, AI demand continues to explode, government programs pushing Sovereign AI levels up, strong earnings.\n\nRisk factors: export ban, valuation near record highs, increased competition, macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIs the global government embrace of AI a bubble or a trend?\n\nWill NVDA correct again in the short term? At what price would you take a position?\n\nIf Trump's policies tighten or the global economy weakens, how big of a hit will it be for NVDA?": 0.5,

  "AMD expects annual AI revenue to grow by more than 60 percent driven by MI300 adoption and expanding EPYC Turin processor cloud deployments - AMD's growth was primarily driven by its Data Center and Artificial Intelligence (AI) businesses, with Data Center revenue increasing 57 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 This growth was driven by strong demand for AMD's EPYC server processors and Instinct AI gas pedals, primarily the MI300 series. AMD is gaining ground in accelerating revenue growth compared to competitors such as Intel and NVIDIA Additionally AMD's expected 2025 price-to-earnings ratio of 37.09 looks overvalued But extending the timeline to 2026 that P/E would fall to 25 16 which is more palatable especially for a company with high double-digit revenue and earnings growth. In contrast, NVIDIA's P/E ratio is typically much higher at similar growth rates So while retrospective metrics suggest AMD is overvalued, forward-looking forecasts suggest the opposite If the company performs as expected and capitalizes on its strong momentum in AI servers and semi-custom businesses, then today's price could very well be tomorrow's bargain": 0.8,

  "Tesla moves to expand Robotaxi to Phoenix, following rival Waymo - Elon Musk\u2019s\u00a0Tesla\u00a0has applied to test and eventually deploy its Robotaxi vehicles in Phoenix, Arizona, following in the footsteps of market leader Waymo.\n\nTesla has applied to conduct autonomous vehicle testing and operations, with and without human safety drivers on board, in Arizona, a spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Transportation told CNBC on Thursday. A decision on the application is expected at the end of July, and Tesla has \u201cexpressed interest in operating within the Phoenix Metro area,\u201d the spokesperson said via email.\n\nReuters first\u00a0reported\u00a0Tesla\u2019s Arizona ambitions.\n\nThe effort to expand to Arizona comes after Tesla in June began a pilot test of its robotaxis in Austin, Texas. Tesla\u2019s Austin fleet includes Model Y SUVs that are equipped with the company\u2019s newest, automated driving systems. Those vehicles are remotely supervised by employees in an undisclosed operations center, and they each include a human safety supervisor who rides with passengers.\n\nThe safety supervisor sits in the front passenger seat, accompanying riders, who are invited fans of Tesla. The supervisor can intervene should the Tesla Robotaxis get into trouble.\n\nWaymo, owned by Google parent\u00a0Alphabet, opened up a driverless robotaxi service to the public in the Phoenix area in 2020.\n\nTesla, which was once seen as a self-driving pioneer, is now working to catch up to Waymo. The companies have distinct approaches to self-driving technology. Tesla claims its choice to mostly use cameras instead of expensive sensors like lidar will make its autonomous vehicles more economically viable.\n\nThe Musk company\u2019s initial efforts in Austin have run into issues.\n\nOne invited passenger, who runs a Tesla-focused YouTube channel called Dirty Tesla, captured an incident\u00a0on camera\u00a0where his Robotaxi dinged a parked car outside of a restaurant.\n\nOther incidents\u00a0where Tesla Robotaxis violated rules of the road in Austin have also been captured on camera and circulated on social media, drawing regulatory\u00a0scrutiny\u00a0from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal vehicle safety agency.\n\nTesla is scheduled to hold a second-quarter earnings call on July 23, during which executives are expected to discuss the initial Robotaxi pilot.\n\nSeparately, Musk on Wednesday\u00a0said on X\u00a0that Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi service will expand to the San Francisco Bay Area \u201cprobably in a month or two.\u201d\n\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles sued Tesla in 2022 alleging that the company made false claims in marketing and advertising about its vehicles\u2019 self-driving capabilities.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/tesla-moves-to-expand-robotaxi-to-phoenix-following-rival-waymo.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/tesla-moves-to-expand-robotaxi-to-phoenix-following-rival-waymo.html)": 0.1,

  "Not sure if this is the best place but have a question on an IPO w/ warrants a company issued - I am trying to better understand what GOVX was offering.  To me it appears that they offered an IPO at .65 USD per share w/ a 5 year warrant.  My understanding is that this warrant can be exercised immediately so if the stock went to $1.00 the buyer could exercise that warrant for a stock correct?   As luck would have it, I already had about 1,500 shares of this company when this IPO went public and it tanked from .96 USD to .49 USD.  From my research, this company has a ton of upside (Which is why i own it).  I then purchased about 12K more shares when it was at .49.  it has since recovered to .67 but my question is about the future value and how someone could have gotten into this IPO.   \n  \nI see a ticker of E8LA mentioned but I have no idea how I could have even gotten into this IPO if i even wanted to.  Currently, it has benefitted me in not doing so but I'm curious about how these work and how they impact future value.  The value of the stock at the time of this IPO was .96 as mentioned so was the company not expecting it to tank as much as it did (And thus screwing existing share holders) or hoping that that undervalued IPO would entice a bunch of buyers and thus capital and the value would quickly recover?  Why would the stock ever get much above their warrant value of .65 with shareholders knowing that there is/was a set value some could purchase it at in the event it rose. and thus creating dilution for existing shareholders.  It makes me almost want to take the gains I got buying a ton at .49. Maybe my thought process on this is entirely wrong (Quite likely) \n\nThanks much,\n\n  \nDave": 0.1,

  "50 percent tarifs on copper and 35 percent tariffs on Canada will suffocate US manufacturers - Global copper demand keeps rising because copper is essential for construction, electrical wiring, renewable energy, and electric vehicles. Many forecasts expect demand to double by 2035 as clean energy and electrification expand.\n\nThe supply chain begins with mining in countries like Chile, Peru, China, the DRC, the U.S., and Canada. Companies like Freeport-McMoRan, Southern Copper, BHP, Rio Tinto, First Quantum Minerals, and Teck Resources handle large-scale mining. The ore is processed, smelted, refined into copper cathodes, and then fabricated into rods, wires, pipes, and sheets. These products feed industries from housing to power grids and EVs.\n\nTraders and exchanges move copper globally to match supply and demand. Lately, traders have leaned more on Chinese buyers to take extra supply, especially when U.S. trade tensions make North American buyers less certain.\n\nIf the U.S. slapped a 50% tariff on imported copper and a 35% tariff on Canadian imports, costs would spike for American manufacturers. Domestic mining can\u2019t fully cover demand, so prices for copper wire, pipes, and components would jump. Canada supplies not just copper but lumber, steel, aluminum, and machinery parts, so tariffs there would push up costs for construction, autos, and clean energy projects.\n\nManufacturers would likely pass some costs to consumers or see profits shrink, while facing global competitors with cheaper inputs. Retaliation from Canada and Latin American producers could hurt U.S. exporters in other sectors. Higher costs would feed inflation and draw political backlash, making such tariffs hard to sustain for long.\n\nSome stocks could see sharp swings if this happened. On the NYSE, Freeport-McMoRan, Southern Copper, GM, Nucor, and Tesla could be more volatile as copper costs and trade flows shift. In Canada, Teck Resources, First Quantum, Hudbay Minerals, Magna International, and Barrick Gold might also swing as exports adjust, buyers shift to China, and investors react.\n\nIn short, the copper supply chain runs from mine to factory through global trade routes. Big tariffs would disrupt that flow, help U.S. miners briefly, but squeeze manufacturers, raise prices, push more supply to China, and likely face strong pressure to be rolled back.\n\nCopper is the Higgs Boson of manufacturing, watching us like a Bozo! it is everywhere..": -0.8,

You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.": 0.2,

  "The Future of Banking shifts and reflects on revenue growth as the rise of online banking and the shrinking of the brick-and-mortar store. - The Brick-and-mortar stores eat into traditional banks' profit margin, which reflects on their slow revenue growth compared to the rapidly growing Fintech banks such as SoFi.  It is a sign of the times.\n\nSoFi's 24/7 One-Stop-Shop does everything that traditional banks do with a fraction of the overhead cost. The savings are rewarded back to the customers, such as 3.80% APY vs. less than the measly 0.01% APY from most traditional banks. Overall, better loan terms and lower costs for Personal Loans, Home Mortgages, and Student Loans. Credit card rewards and provide additional services that are often more than any individual traditional bank.\n\n* Americans are shifting away from brick-and-mortar branches to Online banking.\n* All nations' largest banks have announced branch closures.\n* The growing dominance of digital banking prevails as more customers turn to mobile apps and online platforms.\n* The costs of physical locations are eating into traditional banks' profit margin.\n* Thirty-two bank branches closed nationwide in just one week from March 16 through March 22, 2025.\n* The trend towards brick-and-mortar bank closures has been significantly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Where demand for in-person banking declined.\n* Developing mand expansion of mobile and online banking has drastically reduced individuals' reliance on in-person banking.\n* The rate of bank branch closures has doubled since 2020 and contributes to an overall 5.6% decline in total bank branches since the start of the pandemic, with the majority of closures coming from large and very large banks.\n* Fewer formations of brick-and-mortar banks are replacing the ones that are gone.\n* Physical bank branch reliance is quickly dissipating. The younger demographic generation is quicker to adapt to online banking, while the older population is also catching up to the trend.\n\nMany large banks have announced that more closures will happen in 2025:\n\n* Bank of America: Closing 27 locations\n* JPMorgan Chase: Closing 15 locations\n* Flagstar: Closing 52 locations\n* TD Bank: Closing 37 locations\n* U.S. Bank: Closing 40 locations\n* Wells Fargo: Closing 49 locations\n\n\\* Many of the above bullet points are referenced from an article from Kiplinger that was updated 1 day ago.": 0.8,

  "Trump posted: \u2018The stock market is at an all-time high and interest rates should be cut immediately\u2019! - Former U.S. President Donald Trump just posted heavy rhetoric on social media, praising tech, industrial stocks and cryptocurrencies for their big gains and strongly calling on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Let's break down what he said and analyze the current state of the market with the latest data. Tech stocks, industrial stocks, Nasdaq hit record highs, cryptocurrencies \u201cbreak through the sky\u201d Nvidia (NVDA) is up 47% since the tariffs, the U.S. made hundreds of billions of dollars from the tariffs the country came back and called on the Fed to immediately cut interest rates declaring that \u201cthere is no inflation\u201d .\n\nHow does the market interpret this?\n\nExpectations for rate cuts are heating up: inflation is falling back + political heat is rising in a campaign year, Trump's statement may create some public pressure on the Fed (although its independence remains).\n\nTariffs negative turned positive? : Despite initial concerns that the market was under pressure, from the perspective of capital rotation, industrial, AI and defense stocks have risen, and it seems that the \u201cMade in the USA\u201d narrative is stronger.\n\nNvidia became a symbol: as the AI concept leader, NVDA after the tariffs rose against the trend, became the representative of the \u201cno fear of policy uncertainty\u201d, ARM, SMCI, AVGO, etc. also strengthened, the whole AI plate into the \u201crevaluation period\u201d.\n\nFollow-up possible trend?\n\nIf the next Fed officials do not rush to suppress the rate cut expectations, the market may be the following scenarios\n\n Long beneficiary direction: tech giants (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL), interest rate sensitive growth stocks (ARKK, SMH), industrial/infrastructure stocks (CAT, DE, GE)\n\nRisks to watch out for: QQQ/SPY technicals are close to overheating, Powell or other officials release hawkish letters, earnings season is approaching, and there could be a \u201cpositive cash-out-on-decline\u201d \n\nWhat do our Reddit friends think?\n\nDo you think Trump is just \u201crubbing it in\u201d or is the impact of his policies really being priced into the market?\n\nWill the Fed turn dovish under this political pressure?\n\nAre you still holding NVDA?

  "Trump just announced tariffs on Canada. How does this affect global investors? - That's right. ... Trump is back to \u201cspicing things up\u201d for Canada. On July 11, 2025, the U.S. formally announced that it would be raising tariffs on a range of Canadian goods, and global markets have already begun to react to the news.\n\nBut what does this mean for us investors - whether we're trading, long-term holders, or have exposure to North American assets?\n\nWhy this is worth watching:\n\nNorth American supply chains could be disrupted \n\nFord, GM, Tesla, and even Apple - all of these companies rely heavily on cross-border US/Canada supply chains.\n\nTariff hikes = higher costs = pressured earnings, which could start to show up in next quarter's earnings.\n\n\n\nCanadian markets under pressure \n\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) is already down 1.2% on the news. Sectors such as resource exports and technology parts may come under pressure in the short term.\n\nMoney may shift to U.S. industrials \n\nIf you own U.S.-based industrials like CAT (Caterpillar), DE (Deere), NUE (Nucor Steel), or \\*\\*LMT (Loma), then this wave may be a positive instead.\n\nMy take: \n\nThis isn't just a tariff issue - it's an extension of campaign year political gamesmanship. When news like this hits the ground, the market usually fluctuates and digests it later, with sentiment often reacting before fundamentals.\n\nShort-term positive directions: \n\nUS domestic industrial, construction, steel stocks \n\nAI/EV supply chains not dependent on Canadian imports \n\nPotential risk areas: \n\nCanadian tech exporters \n\nUS-Canadian car joint ventures \n\nIf the situation deteriorates further, the raw materials and energy sectors will suffer as well \n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWould you reduce your exposure to the Canadian market?\n\nWill you be hedging with options or will you continue to wait and see?\n\nWill you take advantage of the volatility and do some short-term trading?\n\nThe markets are really hot and crazy right now, and it's not just the weather.": -0.6,

I know the Vix tracks volatility and that\u2019s a good metric but is there any other data easily accessible I should be looking at? \n\nBecause I know there\u2019s a way to check in yahoo finance which institutions hold positions in certain companies but I haven\u2019t seen anything that easily shows me like if there was $200m volume today 60% of it was funds and the rest was retail. \n\nI really want to know if it\u2019s retail piling in on fomo and can\u2019t control their emotions bringing stocks to all time highs.

  "The Trump Administration appears to be preparing to reschedule cannabis from schedule 1 to 3 - So if you've been following weed stocks at all you likely know that they've been absolutely in the dumps for the past 4.5 years, dropping 95%+ from the ATHs that they set shortly after the 2020 election where Democrats promised to enact cannabis reforms which never materialized.\n\nThe closest that they got was when Biden initiated the scheduling review process for cannabis in 2022, which led to HHS recommending that it should be rescheduled to 3 in 2023, but this process has since stalled in legal limbo with the DEA who were fighting back against the rescheduling effort.\n\nTrump's position on cannabis has been largely unknown given his few comments on the issue but the general consensus has been that he supports rescheduling to 3, state's rights to choose and SAFE banking, which would give cannabis businesses access to the federal banking system. Along this thought, Trump posted this on truth social in September 2024 leading up to the most recent election:\n\n>As President, we will continue to focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug, and work with Congress to pass common sense laws, including safe banking (sic) for state authorized companies, and supporting states rights to pass marijuana laws, like in Florida, that work so well for their citizens.\n\nDespite those comments, the major US cannabis ETF, $MSOS, dropped by over 50% overnight on election day after Trump won, showing that investors had little to no confidence in any positive reform measures coming from the new administration.\n\nSince late June there has been a notable shift. Mike Tyson, a long time friend of Trump for over 30+ years, has been on a media campaign pushing him to finish the rescheduling process that Biden started. This is something that Trump can do on his own without congress. Along with this in the past 2 weeks, there has been a coordinated messaging campaign amongst MAGA social media influencers with millions of followers saying almost identical messaging about how they support Trump's promise to reschedule cannabis to 3 and how it's a good compromise between keeping criminal penalties but allowing more medical research\n\nJust a few examples from the past week alone:\n\n[https://nitter.net/GuntherEagleman/status/1942586646685249971](https://nitter.net/GuntherEagleman/status/1942586646685249971) (1.4M+ followers)\n\n>As a former police officer, I strongly support President Trump on wanting to reschedule marijuana from schedule I to a schedule III.\n\n>Foreign nations are outpacing the U.S. in medical marijuana research, and we must take the lead. Rescheduling is an effective compromise it maintains illegality while enabling critical studies to advance our understanding and innovation in this field.\n\n[https://nitter.net/DC\\_Draino/status/1942325611672056152](https://nitter.net/DC_Draino/status/1942325611672056152) \u00a0(2.2M+ followers)\n\n>Cannabis is absurdly classified alongside heroin as a Schedule I drug and treated more harshly than fentanyl\n\n>Does anyone actually think that makes sense?\n\n>Trump\u2019s campaign promise to move cannabis to Schedule 3 seems like a good compromise\n\n>It maintains criminal penalties while also unlocking critical medicinal research that can save lives\n\n[https://nitter.net/alexbruesewitz/status/1942679927855133017](https://nitter.net/alexbruesewitz/status/1942679927855133017) (Trump Advisor 500k+ followers)\n\n>It's illogical that cannabis is classified as more dangerous than fentanyl. During the campaign President Trump expressed support for rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III, maintaining its illegal status but clearing the path for more robust medical research in our country. Nearly 70% of Republican voters support Trump on this. No brainer!\n\nThere are many more, and even the prohibitionist group, SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana) today claimed that rescheduling was coming very soon in a call to action before swiftly deleting their post  [https://nitter.net/tomangell/status/1943760858821406804](https://nitter.net/tomangell/status/1943760858821406804)\n\nWhile nothing is confirmed yet, this aligns with recent chatter that this is all a \"soft launch\" to prepare everyone for cannabis rescheduling\n\n>Based on what we\u2019re hearing from multiple sources, rescheduling is essentially a sure thing that'll be heavily promoted by Trump in the coming weeks, with a soft-launch underway by many of his supporters/advisors. Given past delays, nothing is set in stone, but optimism is high.\n\nFollowing this shift, $MSOS has double bottomed off of all time lows in late June at around the $2.00 level and is up 43% since, yet to this day, $MSOS is still down nearly 60% from it's price on election day and 46% down from the gap down open that followed election night which was never retested. IMO, any confirmation of rescheduling directly from the administration would quickly bring us back to those levels.\n\nIf rescheduling does occur, it would remove the 280e tax burden on US cannabis companies, a tax law that currently prevents them from taking tax deductions which forces them to pay 70%+ tax rates and prevents many from ever being profitable, and would bring their tax rates down to levels comparable with other businesses. It would also mean that the federal government acknowledges that cannabis has actual medical uses which would have a wide array of benefits like more research and federal medical cannabis regulations.\n\nMy favorite US cannabis company stocks are $GTBIF, which is already profitable and growing among a sea of money losers, and to a smaller extent $TCNNF, which has great margins but is playing a tax game where they're not paying 280e now in hopes that it gets removed which is a larger risk but that's reflected in the stock price": 0.8,

  "(Boeing) Engine fuel supply was cut just before Air India jet crash, preliminary report says - >A cut in the fuel supply to the engines caused last month\u2019s Air India crash that killed 260 people, a preliminary report has found.\n\n>The London-bound plane had barely left the runway at Ahmedabad airport when it hurtled back to earth. Everyone on board was killed, except for one passenger.\n\n>According to the report by India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, obtained by CNN, the fuel control switches in the cockpit of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner had been flipped, starving the engines of fuel. The report does not say whether the control switches were flipped by a person or in another way.\n\n>Investigators were able to get data out of the plane\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d recorders, including 49 hours of flight data and two hours of cockpit audio, including from the crash.\n\n>The aircraft had reached an airspeed of 180 knots when both engines\u2019 fuel cutoff switches were \u201ctransitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec,\u201d according to the report.\n\n>\u201cIn the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,\u201d the report reads.\n\n>Shortly after, the switches were reversed back to where they should have been, and the engines were in the process of powering back up when the crash happened.\n\n>On the 787, the fuel cutoff switches are between the two pilots\u2019 seats, immediately behind the plane\u2019s throttle levers. They are protected on the sides by a metal bar and have a locking mechanism designed to prevent accidental cutoff.\n\n>Airport footage shows the Ram Air Turbine, an emergency power source on an aircraft, deployed during the plane\u2019s initial climb after takeoff, the report said. The plane started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall.\n\n>\u201cWhen fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction,\u201d the report states.\n\n>Seconds after the engines attempted to relight, one pilot called out, \u201cMAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY.\u201d The controller called out for the plane\u2019s callsign, but didn\u2019t get a response and watched the plane crash in the distance.\n\n>The fuel switches were \u201cdesigned to be intentionally moved,\u201d according to CNN safety analyst David Soucie, who said cases in which all fuel switches were turned off accidentally are \u201cextremely rare.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThroughout the years, those switches have been improved to make sure that they cannot be accidentally moved and that they\u2019re not automatic. They don\u2019t move themselves in any manner,\u201d Soucie said on Friday.\n\n>The captain of the flight was a 56-year-old who had flown more than 15,000 hours in his career. The first officer was a 32-year old man with over 3,400 flying hours.\n\n>Investigators also noted settings on equipment found in the wreckage was normal for takeoff. The plane\u2019s fuel was tested and found to be of satisfactory quality, and no significant bird activity is observed in the vicinity of the flight path, according to the report.\n\n>The takeoff weight for the plane was found to be within allowable limits, and there were no \u201cDangerous Goods\u201d on the aircraft. Investigators found the flaps on the wings of the plane were set in the 5-degree position, which is correct for takeoff, and the landing gear lever was in the down position.\n\n>The left engine was installed on the plane on March 26 and the right was installed on May 1, the report said.\n\n>One of the relatives of an Air India victim called for the perpetrators to be punished following the release of the preliminary report. Naresh Maheswari, whose son died in the crash urged the investigators to be neutral, telling India\u2019s ANI news agency that \u201cwe want no one else to die due to such carelessness.\u201d\n\n>The brother-in-law of another of the victims, Niraj Patel, said: \u201cWe want the government to take all kinds of precautions so that people do not lose their family members to such incidents again.\u201d\n\n>The Air India jet took off from Ahmedabad\u2019s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in India\u2019s western state of Gujarat on June 12. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner was headed to London Gatwick and scheduled to land at 6:25 p.m. local time.\n\n>Air India had said 242 passengers and crew members were on board. That included 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian.\n\n>In addition to those on board, a number of people on the ground were killed when the plane crashed into the BJ Medical College and Hospital hostel.\n\n>The crash resulted in 260 fatalities total, according to the report. A number of the dead on the ground resulted from the plane hitting the hostel.\n\n>Air India acknowledged that it received the report and said it will continue cooperating with authorities in the investigation.\n\n>\u201cAir India stands in solidarity with the families and those affected by the AI171 accident,\u201d the airline posted to X on Saturday (local time). \u201cWe continue to mourn the loss and are fully committed to providing support during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nLink: [https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/india/air-india-crash-report-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/india/air-india-crash-report-intl-latam)\n\n  \nMy take: Overall seems to be pilot error rather than anything mechanical, we have decently recovered already from the Air India crash so not sure if this will move the needle further.": -0.8,

  "Allegion : what am I missing ? (ALLE, ASSA-B, DOKA) - Hello,\n\nIt seems to me that nobody cares about Allegion. Please tell why you haven't bought it or why you wouldn't. I already made a post elsewhere and nobody answered. In this post I also speak about major competitors Assa Abloy and Dormakaba\n\n# Allegion (ALLE)\n\nAllegion is a lock, (automatic) door and anti-fire window manufacturer. It also made investments in various technology start-ups (Allegion Ventures). It is a spin-off from Ingersoll Rand (the old one) in 2014. It has a high profitability and is a serial acquirer.\n\n**Asset allocation**\n\nIt makes a good number of acquisitions, but also some divestments from time to time. If you look at the constant high profitability (10%-17% since 2016), we can say it is selective with its acquisitions. They continue to make a lot of money on their total assets. Notable acquisition : Stanley access technologies in 2022 from Stanley Black & Decker, that is their entry in the automatic door market.\n\nThey use a high leverage (equity ratio of about 30%), they distribute about 30% of their earnings and are doing a lot of buyback (37% of earnings for \\~1.2% of outstanding shares (net of dillution) in average) at attractive prices (at the moment at least).\n\nIn 2025 they bought :\n\n\\* Waitwhile (queue managing software)\n\n\\* Gatewise (access control software for multi-family buildings)\n\n\\* Next door (US glass/metal and metal doors manufacturer for commercial buildings)\n\n\\* Trimco (manufacturer of custom/branded door handles)\n\n\\* Lemaar (residential door handles in Australia)\n\n\\* Novas (door handles, electronic locks, door sealing in Australia)\n\n\\* ELATEC (electronic locks in Germany)\n\n**Evolution of earnings (USD)**\n\n2.36 (16), 2.85 (17), 4.54 (18), 4.26 (19), 3.39 (20), 5.34 (21), 5.19 (22), 6.12 (23), 6.82(24), 7.12 (rolling 12)\n\nDividend went from 0.64 to 2.04. The dividends are subject to irish witholding tax.\n\n**Management & board**\n\nThere is a good stability in the management, eventhough CEO John Stone has been hired in 2022.\n\nFor example SVP International Timothy Eckersley was managing the american commercial activities of what was to become Allegion in 2007-2013, then the Americas division (this time including residential as well) in 2013-2020 before leading the international business from 2021. SVP Americas David Llardi joined the group in 2008 and was promoted in 2022. ( [https://ibb.co/jvxb5CyT](https://ibb.co/jvxb5CyT) )\n\nIt is less the case on the board with some recent departures of long-time members. ( [https://ibb.co/zWHs08L2](https://ibb.co/zWHs08L2) )\n\n**Other**\n\nThere is some risks about the tariffs, considering for example that some of the manufacturing for the american market is done in Mexico.\n\n# Assa Abloy\n\nAssa Abloy is a lock, window elements, (automatic) door and gate manufacturer. It is a merger from 1994 between Assa and Abloy. It has an average profitability. It is 3 times bigger than Allegion.\n\n**Asset allocation**\n\nIt makes a good number of acquisitions. If you look at the lower profitability (9%-11.5%, except for 2018), we can say it is less selective with its acquisitions than Allegion. Notable acquisitions : HHI (Kwikset, Baldwin & Weiser etc.) for 4.3B$ in 2023, that is most of their North American residential business segment. The group has a bigger diversification in term of businesses (senior care alarms, RFID for uniforms, perimeter security etc).\n\nThey use a lower leverage (equity ratio of about 50%), they distribute about 45% of their earnings. They don't really buy back their shares.\n\n**Evolution of earnings (SEK)**\n\n5.99 (16), 7.77 (17), 2.48 (18\\*), 9.22 (19), 7.54 (20), 9.81 (21), 11.97 (22), 13.54 (23), 14.09 (24), 14.17 (rolling 12m)\n\n\\*goodwill impairement China\n\nDividend went from 3 to 5.9. The dividends are subject to swedish witholding tax.\n\n**Management & Board**\n\nThere is a good stability in term of management. CEO Nico Delvaux has been hired in his position in 2018. ( [https://ibb.co/TDGx1h4x](https://ibb.co/TDGx1h4x) )\n\nThere is always 3-4 members of the board sent by major sharholders Latour and Sch\u00f6rling ( [https://ibb.co/xtRKCvBh](https://ibb.co/xtRKCvBh) )\n\n**Other**\n\nThere is some risks about the tariffs as they now make 47% of their sales in the US.\n\nThe company is controlled by long term shareholders Latour and Sch\u00f6rling.\n\n# Dormakaba\n\nDormakaba is a lock, door, movable wall, key machine manufacturer. Dormakaba is the result of the 2015 merger between swiss Kaba and german Dorma. The swiss holding (what you buy on the stock market) owns 52.5% of the german holding (who owns all the businesses). The ex-owners of Dorma kept 47.5% of the german holding and of the merged activities. In addition, the ex-owners of Dorma, together with some ex-owners of Kaba own a total of 28% of the swiss holding. It is the smallest company of the 3.\n\nThe company has very low margins (remember to not exclude earnings of the minority interests to calculate profitability as most of them are the 47.5%). It has made some acquisitions, some of them beeing service companies, but it also made a lot of divestments in recent years.\n\n**Evolution of earnings (CHF)**\n\n12.8 (16), 27.7 (17), 29.5 (18), 31.5 (19), 20.3 (20), 24.1 (21), 15.1 (22), 10.9 (23), 10 (24), 16 (rolling 12m)\n\nDividend went from 12 to 8. The dividends are subject to swiss witholding tax (partly).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI don't understand why Allegion has a P/E of 20.9 in itself. Assa Abloy, which is not as good, has a P/E of 21.4. Dormakaba, which is the worst, has a P/E of 46.75. Has anybody an idea about what I am missing ?\n\nThe \"negative\" elements don't seem to explain why it is cheap. Yes, there is a tariff risk (same as a lot of companies), there is irish witholding tax, I guess it could get out of S&P500 due to its size (#436 a month ago). The company doesn't have some caracteristics that a lot of investor want (it is an industrial company and it is not a dividend aristrocrat YET).\n\nPlease note that I own shares in Allegion and that might influence my opinion on the group.": 0.5,

  "Powell's ouster 'one of the biggest underestimated event risks in the coming months - U.S. President Donald Trump's potential removal of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could lead to a \u2018meltdown\u2019 in currency and bond markets and a spike in inflation expectations, Deutsche Bank said on Friday.\n\nEarlier this week, Russell Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, accused Powell of \u2018gross\u2019 mismanagement of the Fed and said renovations to the Fed's headquarters were \u2018way over budget\u2019 and that the cost of the project had ballooned to about $2.5 billion.\n\nThe allegation could open the door for Trump to seek Powell's removal. The president has repeatedly criticised the Fed chairman for failing to lower interest rates and has hurled a series of insults at him. He has reportedly considered firing Powell and appointing a successor before the end of his term.\n\nGeorge Salaveros, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, noted that the market now expects Powell's ouster to be very unlikely. According to forecasting platform Polymarket, the likelihood of Powell stepping down is currently 15 per cent.\n\nBut Salaveros offered some thoughts on the possible implications.\n\nHe says: \"The empirical and academic evidence on the impact of a loss of central bank independence is fairly clear: in the extreme case, both currency and bond markets could collapse as inflation expectations rise, real yields fall, and broader risk premiums rise due to institutional erosion. Interestingly, the implications for equities are even more ambivalent given that they are ultimately a claim on real assets.\"\n\nIt is difficult to quantify the impact on FX and interest rates, but in the first 24 hours after Powell's announcement of his departure, we expect the trade-weighted dollar to fall by at least 3-4 per cent, while US fixed income will suffer a 30-40 basis point sell-off, led by the back end,\u2019 Salaveros said.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the market's reaction to the initial news will depend on whether the remaining Fed policymakers \u2018agree\u2019 around the central bank's independence, the choice of Powell's successor, and the broader macroeconomic context.\n\nHe added: \u2018All in all, we see Chairman Powell's departure as one of the biggest underestimated event risks in the coming months.\u2019\n\nThis week, trade dynamics have been at the centre of Wall Street's attention, overshadowing monetary policy and the Federal Reserve. Here are some of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the benchmark S&P 500 Index ( SP500 ): ( NYSEARCA: SPY ), ( NYSEARCA: VOO ), ( NYSEARCA: IVV ), ( NYSEARCA: RSP ), ( NYSEARCA: SSO ), ( NYSEARCA: UPRO ), ( NYSEARCA: SH ), ( NYSEARCA: SDS ) and ( NYSEARCA: SPXU ).\n\nTo track currencies, here's the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and some related ETFs: ( NYSEARCA: UUP ), ( NYSEARCA: USDU ) and ( NYSEARCA: UDN ).\n\nHere are some fixed income linked funds: ( NASDAQ: TLT ), ( NYSEARCA: TLH ), ( NASDAQ: IEF ), ( NASDAQ: IEI ), ( NASDAQ: SHY ), ( NYSEARCA: SGOV ), ( NYSEARCA: SCHO ), ( NYSEARCA: BIL ), ( NYSEARCA: AGG ), ( NASDAQ: BND ), ( NASDAQ: VCIT ), ( NYSEARCA: MUB ), ( NASDAQ: MBB ), ( NYSEARCA: JNK ), ( NYSEARCA: LQD ), ( NYSEARCA: HYG ) and ( NYSEARCA: TIP ).": -0.8,

It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports.\n\n\"While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,\" Hegseth said in the video online. \"Not anymore.\"\n\nThe memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by \"approving hundreds of American products\" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a \"variety of low-cost drones\" made by American engineers and AI experts.\n\nThe order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use.\n\n\"Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,\" the memo said.\n\nLastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars.\n\n\"Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,\" Hegseth wrote in the memo.\n\nThe announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace.": 0.8,

Im talking real profits, government-grade access, and a fat pile of cash. The cherry on top? They're pivoting into a another revenue stream. They have a B2B SaaS expansion plan that (might) just take them from TSA side hustle to enterprise verification empire.\n\n**So who is YOU anyway?**\n\nClear Secure is the company behind those VIP \"skip the line\" biometric lanes in airports, stadiums, and other big venues. It's the TSA PreCheck if TSA actually moved at human speed. They call it Clear Plus, and it's already used by 30M+ people.\n\nThen there's the revenue pivot... CLEAR1, a B2B identity verification platform. Think: LinkedIn, Uber, and even T-Mobile using Clear tech to make sure users/employees aren't bots or stolen IDs. IF that hits? You're looking at a low-key SaaS transformation.\n\n**Lets talk money**\n\n* FCF margins: 40%+\n* GAAP profitable with net income up 6x YoY\n* Zero debt, $1.3 billie in cash (if you did the math then yes... That's $9-10/share just sitting there)\n* And they're buying back shares AND paying a dividend like a grown up (isnt that cute)\n\n**What can send this thing on the next flight to the moon?**\n\n* CLEAR1 traction.

It would take a lot to set this thing below $20 so thats where I am estimating the floor.\n* Ceiling: Mid thirties is totally reasonable on execution, possibly $40+ if CLEAR1 becomes the next Okta-for-humans\n* Current PPS: $29\n* Target PPS: $34-36\n* Expected Upside: Approx 20-25%\n* Divvy?

  "Asian stocks steady amid Trump's new tariff measures, China stocks rise on strong trade data; Wall Street futures fall - Asian stocks were mostly steady on Monday as investors reacted to new trade tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump, while Chinese shares rose on strong June trade data.\n\n\n\nHeightened global trade friction also weighed on market sentiment as U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico from Aug. 1 onward.\n\n\n\nIn response, EU and Mexican officials have expressed a willingness to negotiate, and the EU has begun talks with other affected partners.\n\n\n\nGold prices hovered around $3,350 an ounce on Monday, near a three-week high.\n\n\n\nJapan's stock market ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.01% Monday , falling below 39,500; the TSE stock index fell 0.2% to 2,817. Japanese stocks hit more than two-week lows as renewed trade tensions dampened market sentiment. The yen rose to 147 against the dollar on Monday, recovering some of the ground lost last week as investors reacted to renewed global trade concerns.\n\n\n\n2025 In May, Japan's industrial production fell 0.1% from a year earlier, down from a preliminary 0.5% increase, after falling 1.1% in April, the second consecutive monthly decline.\n\n\n\nOn the economic front, Japan's core machinery orders fell 0.6% m/m to 913.5 billion yen in May.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, China (SSE Composite Index) gained 0.46% to above 3,525 points, while the SZSE Composite Index fell 0.2% to 10,670 points. Mainland stocks were mixed as investors weighed strong trade data against a fresh round of geopolitical tensions, with the offshore yuan trading at around 7.17 against the dollar on Monday.\n\n\n\nIn June 2025, China's trade surplus increased to $114.77 billion, with exports up 5.8% to $325.2 billion and imports up 1.1% to $210.4 billion.\n\n\n\nAlso adding support to the market was news that China and ASEAN plan to submit an upgraded free trade agreement for ratification in October.\n\n\n\nInvestors are now eyeing China's Q2 GDP data due on Tuesday, with growth expected to slow to 5.2% from 5.4% in the first quarter.\n\n\n\nHong Kong (Hang Seng) gained 0.77% to 24,190 in early trading on Monday, its third consecutive session of gains, after Goldman Sachs upgraded Hong Kong equities to market weight, citing strong earnings growth due to improving capital markets and a pickup in real estate activity.\n\n\n\nIndia's (SENSEX) index fell 0.33% to 82,229 points in early trading Monday, hovering at its lowest level in two weeks and falling for a fourth straight session.\n\n\n\nAustralia's (AS51) index rose 0.01% to close at 8,572 points on Monday after falling slightly by 0.1%. U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his threat of tariffs, reigniting fears of an outbreak of a global trade war and causing investors to turn cautious. The Australian dollar fell to around $0.656 against the greenback on Monday, reversing last week's gains.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, all three major U.S. stock indexes closed lower after President Trump announced 35% tariffs on Canadian imports and warned of further tariff increases globally\n\n\n\nU.S. stock index futures fell sharply on Monday after President Trump threatened to impose 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico starting August 1st. : Dow Jones -0.40%; S&P 500 -0.44%; Nasdaq -0.40%.": -0.8,

  "EU issues tough warning of countermeasures if US-EU trade talks break down - will markets falter? - Background Sorting: \n\nTrade tensions between the US and Europe have heated up again over the past two weeks. Despite the departure of the Biden administration, Trump reinstated some of the tariffs on Europe prior to his campaign, particularly related to automobiles, precision manufacturing equipment and green energy products.\n\nToday, EU Vice-President Sefcovic made it clear that if negotiations fail, the EU will not hesitate to take reciprocal countermeasures, including imposing tariffs or limits on U.S. high-tech products, cloud services and chip equipment.\n\nShort-term market judgment: \n\nIf the US-EU talks continue to stall, it will weigh on large-cap tech stocks in the short- to medium-term, especially for companies with high international revenue share (e.g., NVDA, AAPL, AMD).\n\nHowever, if positive signals of progress in negotiations can be released later this week, the market will repair quickly.\n\nThe current rise in volatility expectations for August in the options market suggests that institutions are already hedging their bets against conflicting risks.\n\nMy strategy (not a recommendation): \n\nLightly hold tech ETFs (e.g. QQQ) and closely monitor the EU response meeting on 7/16 \n\nIf conflict escalates, plan to buy short-term defensive ETFs (e.g. XLU / SH) if the VIX breaks 15+ \n\nWatch for shifts in international stances during the Biden and Trump campaigns, as the policy set-ups will influence the direction of capital allocation in Sept.\n\nWhat do our Reddit friends think?\n\nDo you think the EU will really do something to counter it, or is it just a bargaining chip?\n\nHow will the escalation of the U.S.-EU trade war affect your holdings (especially tech stocks)?\n\nHow do you plan to hedge your bets if things continue to deteriorate?": 0.1,

  "The future of film. Netflix or some other company? - Netflix has announced that they will begin showing AI generated ads in 2026. It's pretty clear what happens from there. What starts as 15-30 second AI-generated advertisements shown in the middle of your favorite TV series eventually evolves into 40-50 minute AI-generated episodes that *become* your new favorite TV series.\n\nAt some point in the not too distant future, and perhaps sooner than you think, the major streaming platforms will start rolling out feature-length films and TV series created entirely with AI. Over time, the quality will improve to be indistinguishable from real life.\n\nThe future of film is not in big budget productions with a cast of A-list stars. The future of film is in AI-generated content, created for pennies on the dollar and with very few human actors. Movies and series will be produced not over several months or years on set at some studio in Hollywood but in a few days or hours from who knows where. Like Bibles with the introduction of the printing press, they'll be produced in the thousands.\n\nAnd companies can limit their exposure to risk by shifting to an On Demand model. Sure, there will be established franchises like Marvel and Star Wars and others they'll keep dishing out, but long gone will be the days when a studio drops $150M on a movie that flops.\n\nBecause the future of film won't be just Netflix Original content (or another company's), much of it will be *your* content. You'll have the power of Gen AI at your fingertips.\n\nIt won't be long until you can log into Netflix or another platform, and with a simple prompt or a choice of a few options, generate an entire film or TV series that you can watch that day and share with your friends. User content will be circulated and rated like your aunt's potato salad recipe on Allrecipes.com.\n\nMovies are inherently procedural. Every story, at least a decent one, has:\n\n* Structure (Freytag's pyramid, Three-act Play, The Hero's Journey, etc)\n* Plot (Rags to Riches, Overcoming the Monster, Comedy, Tragedy, and Rebirth, etc)\n* Theme (Love, Good vs Evil, Coming of Age, etc)\n* Tone (Serious, Uplifting, Bleak, etc)\n* Conflict (Man vs Man, Man vs Society, Man vs Nature, etc)\n* Characters (Humans, Elves, Demons, Robots, Zombies, etc)\n* Setting (Present Day, Apocalyptic, Alternate Dimension, Mars, etc)\n\nYou'll be able mix and match all of these elements and generate a prompt. BOOM - you have a new film or TV series that you'll be the first to view. Give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and Netflix will learn from your prompt and produce better recipes tailored just for you. You'll be able to share it with your friends on Netflix too. Top rated user content will be owned by Netflix who can sell it or rent it. Maybe they'll give you a percentage of the profit.\n\nIf you want a franchise with 20 movies, you'll have it. If you want TV series with 50 seasons, you'll have it.\n\nSo, what could the future look like?\n\nNetflix has a current market cap of $529B with subscriptions priced between $7.99 and $24.99/mo. It's not unrealistic to double, triple, or even quadruple these costs to provide what I just described. As a millennial, I remember paying $70ish for cable 10-15 years ago. You have to believe people will be willing to pay a similar cost for On Demand film.\n\nIs it unrealistic to forecast Netflix with a market cap of $2T?\n\nPerhaps it's Google (Alphabet), not Netflix who will capitalize on this - and they won't just stick to movies and series. They'll evolve YouTube into a Generative AI hub. Create film, series, vlogs, and more. Veo3 is impressive. How much more capable will it be in 10 years?\n\nIf Nvidia is building \"AI factories\" to produce off-the-shelf AI models, then on-demand AI film is not so far fetched.\n\nThey say Tom Cruise saved Hollywood with Top Gun 2.

  "AI is overvalued - I am going to preface this with the fact I have worked in the AI field with some big companies for about 10 years now and understand everything about AI and how it works. \n\nI think a AI bubble is here, we are overvalueing every company that seems to use AI for the sole reason that it uses AI. We are creating a bubble of artificial valuation. AI has many uses and I do believe we will continue using it in the future, but that does not mean it is now the most powerful market indicator. The value of AI companies should be based on the integration value. Why does every AI company hit huge numbers shortly after the launch. It makes no sense. The whole point of valuation is how much shareholder value can they provide and with many of these new companies that number is real low. We are throwing money at these useless AI companies for absolutely no reason. We can look at a example of OpenAI. They are at the cutting edge of LLM  technology. It is never going to become the next \"Google\" and while I do think it is amazing what they do and I use Chatgpt often, why does everyone say they are undervalued. It isn't a trillion dollar company. That is just one dumb example though. The real overvaluation is the 75% of AI companies that are truly useless. We will always use AI in the future as a society, but it won't be a million companies, it will be the best of the best that we use for everything. \n\nThere are countless AI companies that all think because they use AI they are the future, and we do fall for it. I think that in the near future there will be a AI burst. The bubble will finally collapse, it will hit everyone harder than we would ever expect. I have no idea when its going to happen, could be this year, could be next, and could be in 5 years. The overvaluation of AI is at least 50% artificial. \n\nShorting AI might sound stupid, and it could be I am totally wrong, but what if I am right. \n\nEdit: I am not talking about the big hitters in the AI industry. The OpenAI, Palantir, Nvidia are all huge and extremely impactful. I am solely saying these are the companies that will survive. They are so ahead of everyone else that in 1 day they can teach a model to do virtually anything. Other companies will be forced to die out. This is just my prediction for the future of AI.": -0.8,

  "$MEOH (Methanex): Why no love? - Let me disclose upfront:\n\n* I've held MEOH for 10+ years\n* My avg cost is low $20s.\n* I\u2019m not trying to offload shares, I\u2019m holding and might add.\n* I'm posting here to get thoughts, build awareness (of course it helps boost my port value), and understand why it gets little or no attention.\n\n# What is Methanex?\n\n* World's largest methanol producer.\n* Converts natural gas into methanol and ships it globally.\n* Stable, profitable commodity business\n* Canadian (based on Vancouver, BC)\n* I can hear the yawns already\n\n# OCI Acquisition\n\n* \\~$1.2B in cash\n* \\~9.9 million new MEOH shares (about 15% dilution)\n* \\~$450M in assumed debt/leases\n\nAssets acquired:\n\n* Two \"world-scale\" methanol plants in Beaumont, Texas\n   * Includes OCI Beaumont and a 50% stake in Natgasoline (largest U.S. methanol plant)\n   * One plant also produces ammonia\n* A global low-carbon methanol production and marketing business (OCI HyFuels)\n* An idled plant in the Netherlands (Delfzijl)\n\nWhy the idled plant?  \nDelfzijl gives Methanex a pre-built, permitted foothold in Europe. It\u2019s currently offline but useful for future growth or clean fuel mandates. In short, it gives them optionality, not immediate contribution.\n\n# Stock Reaction\n\n* Stock dropped \\~25% since just before the OCI deal was announced on 9/8/24.\n* $33.58 as I write this on 7/14/25\n* CEO bought 2,958 shares (\\~$150K) in mid-June at \\~$37.50.\n* BMO set a $65 target (>90% upside).\n\n# Valuation Snapshot\n\n* Trailing EPS (Q1 2025): about $3.29\n* P/E ratio: about 10 to 11 times\n* Forward P/E: about 13 times consensus\n* Reasonable for a profitable, now larger, industrial business\n\n# How much capacity did OCI add?\n\n* Methanex now reports 10.4 million tonnes per year (mtpa) total operating capacity.\n* OCI assets added about 2.6 mtpa active capacity, with optional upside from Delfzijl (about 1 mtpa idle).\n* That's a \\~44% increase in total potential capacity.\n\n# EPS Upside Estimate\n\n* If OCI is successfully integrated and margins hold:\n   * EPS could rise from \\~$3.30 to $4.50\n* At that level, the forward P/E at today\u2019s price ($34) would drop to \\~7.5 to 8 times\n\n# Future Stock Price Scenarios\n\n|EPS|8\u00d7 P/E|10\u00d7 P/E|12\u00d7 P/E|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$4.30|$34.40|$43.00|$51.60|\n|$4.60|$36.80|$46.00|$55.20|\n\n* Base case: $46 to 55 (if integration succeeds and valuation normalizes)\n* Upside case: $60 or more (if methanol market strengthens or Europe ramps clean fuels)\n* Downside case: Flat if OCI adds little and macro weakens\n\n# What\u2019s coming next?\n\nQ2 Earnings on 7/30\n\n* OCI deal closed 7/27, so only 3 days included in Q2\n* Expect:\n   * Confirmation of close\n   * One-time charges\n   * Management commentary\n* Don\u2019t expect:\n   * Full OCI financials\n   * Revised guidance (likely Q3)\n\nReal impact shows up in Q3 (Oct/Nov) once OCI results are fully consolidated.\n\n# Insider Buying History\n\n|Date|Price|6\u2011Mo Ret|12\u2011Mo Ret|Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mar 2020|$22.00|\\+48%|\\+120%|COVID recovery|\n|Nov 2016|$35.00|\\+15%|\\+40%|Methanol supercycle|\n|Aug 2014|$60.00|\u201320%|\u201335%|Oil crash|\n|May 2012|$30.00|\\+5%|\\+25%|Steady growth|\n|Jun 2025|$37.50|TBD|TBD|Post-OCI, stock now $33.40|\n\n# Expected reader pushback:\n\n* \u201cAnalyst targets are BS\u201d: fair\n* \u201cInsider buys are small\": fair\n* \u201cYou\u2019re betting on OCI and methanol demand\": fair\n* Canadian stock, so US investors get hit with foreign taw withdrawal on dividends\n* Commodity stocks are volatile\n* MEOH has little options interest and therefore lacks leverage/excitement, comparatively speaking\n\nHere\u2019s why I\u2019m holding:\n\n* I have a good cost basis.\n* The capacity added by the acquisition of OCI is real, running and producing.\n* EPS could rise 30 to 40 percent over time\n* Forward P/E could drop to about 7.5 to 8 times\n* Methanex has stayed profitable through multiple cycles.\n* Balance sheet still manageable after the deal\n\n#  Risks\n\n* OCI integration underperforms\n* Methanol demand weakens\n* Trump tariff wars, macro instability (e.g. Chinese demand)\n* Dilution doesn\u2019t get offset by future earnings\n\n#  Bottom Line\n\nThis isn\u2019t a meme stock or a fast mover. It is a scaled-up, globally positioned chemical producer trading at about 10 to 11 times earnings now, possibly less than 8 times forward, with clear upside if execution goes right.\n\nThat's a lot of \"ifs,\" \"coulds,\" etc.\n\nStill, I\u2019m watching Q3. I\u2019ll likely buy if it dips under $30.   \n  \nIn the mean time, I'm wondering: Why no discussion for MEOH?\n\nThoughts?": 0.5,

  "Servicenow, Copart, Berkshire - your opinion on buying these stocks now? - Right now, these three stocks are my hottest picks on the watchlist.\n\nServicenow is around 20% down from its ATH, had a bigger drawdown around April but I missed this opportunity. Right now, it's one of the few tech stocks that are big but not one of the FAANG companies that are not on ATH.\n\nCopart is around 28% down from its ATH, with the lowest stock price since January 2024. The stock is in a very long-term upward trend, it could drop below 200 EMA soon for the first time in ages though soon.\n\nBerkshire is around 12% down from its ATH. It's a stock that you never get cheap, the last time it had such a drawdown was in 2023. Buffett retiring concerns me a bit though, it was inevitable considering his age, but he practically was Berkshire and his departure could take away from the \"myth\" BRK.\n\nWhat do you think about these three stocks right now?": 0.5,
