  "Trump\u2019s Tax Bill Ekes Through House. The President Meets His Deadline. - President Donald Trump and Republicans will hit their July 4 deadline to pass the president\u2019s signature tax and spending legislation and sign it into law. Now the pressure will be on to convince voters that Trump\u2019s achievement will make the U.S. economy stronger. Americans thus far aren\u2019t convinced.\n\nThe House voted 218-214 to pass the bill, which extends the individual tax cuts that Trump originally signed into law in 2017, among other provisions.\n\nOver the past two days, fiscal conservatives have lambasted the bill for adding a projected $3.4 trillion to the $36.2 trillion national debt over the next decade. Meanwhile, some GOP moderates expressed concern about the bill\u2019s cuts to Medicaid that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said will likely result in nearly 12 million people losing their insurance coverage.\n\nIn the end, both groups folded without any changes. Some previous holdouts said the White House made assurances on how they would enforce certain provisions in the bill, while House leadership also suggested Republicans would have a chance to pass another bill to make changes later in the year.\n\nRead More:\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-tax-bill-house-pass-9e230859": -0.6,

  "Businesses are clear beneficiaries of the new bill, pushing corporate expansions and stock prices to new heights with new tax breaks. - **Big corporations would see a drastic rise in revenue resulting from tax cuts and relief from the rejection of proposed tax bills.  Corporate America gets a sigh of relief for expansion and new investment allowed by the increased revenue and liquidity.  Many small businesses will benefit as well, which will funnel additional funding to the large corporations.**\n\n* This makes the dropped corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% permanent and lowers marginal income tax rates for most tax brackets.\n* Rejection of increase in stock buyback tax.\n* Rejection of proposed tax bills that would have limited state and local deductions for corporations.\n* The new tax bill is\u00a0set to benefit private student loan lenders, such as SoFi, which could see a jump in demand.\n* Many of the tax breaks from the 2017 TCJA (originally set to expire in 2025) will become permanent.\n* Restore a tax break from the 2017 tax package that allowed businesses to fully write off the cost of equipment in the first year it was purchased\n* Allow businesses to write off the cost of research and development in the year it was incurred\n* Businesses will be allowed to fully and immediately deduct the cost of building new manufacturing facilities.\n* QBI for Small Businesses and Partnerships (formed by lawyers, doctors, and investors) will increase through the House Proposal from 20% to 23% from now until 2029.

  "Carmakers Seek to Offset Tariffs as EU-US Trade Talks Near End - Some European Union carmakers and capitals are pushing for an agreement with President Donald Trump that would allow for tariff relief in return for increasing investments in the US, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\n\nMember states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\n\nThe EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc\u2019s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.\n\n\n\nUS and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nAny deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.\n\n\n\nThe commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.\n\n\n\nThe people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they\u2019re prepared to accept in any deal.\n\n\n\nSome capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don\u2019t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump\u2019s levies with countermeasures.\n\n\n\nThe bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,\u201d Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. \u201cWe will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe EU has approved tariffs on \u20ac21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump\u2019s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.\n\n\n\nThe bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on \u20ac95 billion of American products in response to Trump\u2019s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.\n\n  \nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-04/carmakers-seek-to-offset-tariffs-as-eu-us-trade-talks-near-end?srnd=homepage-americas](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-04/carmakers-seek-to-offset-tariffs-as-eu-us-trade-talks-near-end?srnd=homepage-americas)": 0.1,

This was after a bit of research and advice. I went for VGK as it is very very slow but seems to be consistent enough to where im willing to invest a bit in it (also due to a hint of hesitancy in the American market). \n\nMy question arrives as I get older and I feel like im entering the best years of my life to invest. My best stock, far none, has been Costco. Ive continually invested in Cosco from when it was around 180 or so a share. Without a doubt, it has been my best share. Partially due to luck but also research from when I was younger. \n\nNevertheless, with an uncertain market in the states, I worry about keeping my portfolio to where it is right now (in which I am in afew industries with VTI and VGK as my two etfs and around 14 individual stocks in a decent arrange of industries). The main being Industrials and health care. In which I would like to expand to a more agricultural side of things and more industrial planning. \n\nSo, I do ask, which stock has been your best far for your portfolio?": 0.5,

  "Waymo's moat is overrated. AVs will become a commodity not a winner take all - There\u2019s a popular view that Waymo will dominate AVs like Google did with search. But that oversimplifies how transport, hardware, and regulation actually work. AVs likely won\u2019t be winner-take-all. More likely, autonomy becomes a commodity layer like smartphone OS or GPS chips where value shifts to branding, logistics, and vertical integration.\n\nEven if Waymo has the best tech, that doesn\u2019t guarantee market control.

Delivery and ride-share players  may care more about cost and scale than whose software is inside.\n\nOnce the tech stabilizes, margins shrink and the real competition moves up the stack.

  "Well, the real economy will end up tagging the market, but when and how? - Despite the recent resilience, the US stock market will likely stumble at some point when it get tired to reach new highs. Many, including me, initially thought the economy would crash faster after tariffs, but instead a deep slowdown is hitting per some comments on my previous post; therefore, I dare to rethink. \n\nPossible  that real unemployment numbers are worse than what appears on the surface. Oil prices were expected to significantly soar during the short US/Israel vs Iran conflict, but they spiked far lower than anyone thought for now, may be to test some resistance and to adjust to the recent Opec cartel production boost. Tesla was expected to crash, holding and dancing for now with better than expected Q2 sales in light of brand damage, but brand damage is incurable, and it seems that Elon no longer care.

You:\n\n* Select the two highest-ranked stocks in each of the ten major sectors\n* Equal-weight them in the portfolio\n* Hold for one year\n* Rebalance annually based on updated rankings\n\nIt is fully systematic and intentionally avoids subjective decision-making. No news-based trades, no earnings reactions, no macro predictions.\n\n# A Track Record of Outperformance\n\nNAPS has quietly outperformed many professional fund managers and the FTSE All-Share over the past decade in the UK. Its success comes from combining factor-based investing with sector diversification and sticking to it.\n\n# What If You Ran It in the U.S.?\n\nThis got me thinking: what would a U.S.-based NAPS portfolio look like if you applied the same rules to the U.S. stock market? Using something like Stockopedia\u2019s U.S. coverage or a similar QVM screening method (like Portfolio123 or Finbox), you could replicate the structure:\n\n* Ten sectors\n* Two top-ranked stocks per sector\n* Rebalance once a year\n* Set it and forget it\n\nThe question is: which 20 stocks would make the list right now?": 0.6,
  "Could leveraged ETFs make much money on July 9 when Trump's deadline expires and he wants to raise tariffs? Any thoughts would be welcome! - My general thesis is that on July 9, the Stock Market may crash because that's when the foolishness of Trump's trade tariffs will be made clear when his 90 Day Tariffs end on that day. He will not have anything like a clear plan and will not have any countries willing to sign on with him. At that point, the trade-policy gobbledygook will suddenly evaporate and we will have a much clearer view of the the threats to our economy, these including: inflation, rises in cost of living, unemployment, uncertainty and apprehension about the future, etc.\n\nTrump has been making a lot of money for himself and his friends with suddenly raising and lowering tariffs, but he makes money as much of the country loses money.\n\nAlso, he is cheating, breaking the law as he engages in his tariff manipulation and should be punished in some way.\n\nI'd welcome any thoughts on this. Thanks!": -0.8,

  "Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq futures fall as Trump targets August 1 for country-by-country tariffs - US stock futures fell Sunday as President Trump and top administration officials suggested country-specific tariffs would take effect on Aug. 1, offering more potential confusion to trading partners but also potential breathing room for negotiations.\n\nFutures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), the S&P 500 (ES=F), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) all dropped around 0.3%.\n\nTrump had targeted July 9 as a self-imposed deadline, when his \"pause\" on steep April tariffs would go back into effect. Global markets have been bracing for that potential shock, with the US only having reached deals with the UK and Vietnam, as well as a framework toward an agreement with China.\n\nBut on Sunday, both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump suggested that while Trump could send out letters this week informing countries of their tariff rates, those duties would not go into effect until Aug. 1.\n\n\"President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on Aug. 1 you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\" Bessent told CNN's \"State of Union.\"\n\nAAPL, DDOG, BGM, MDB, TEAM, and OKTA could benefit if progress on trade deals helps stabilize sentiment and supports a rebound in both large-cap tech and mid-cap growth names.\n\nBessent hinted at several possible deals in the coming days, suggesting the focus this week is clarity with 18 major trading partners before setting duties for the 100-plus other countries that the administration has in its sights for trade taxation.

  "Trump\u2019s July Tariff Deadline Likely Pushed to August  How Will It Impact Markets? - The anticipation surrounding President Trump's tariff deadline for July 9 seems to be slipping into August, and potentially even beyond, with the latest updates suggesting a more extended timeline for these trade talks. While the administration has touted finalizing agreements soon, trade talks, especially with major partners like the EU, Japan, and India, still seem unresolved\n\nDeadline Shift: Trump\u2019s team previously set a July 9 deadline, but with continued negotiations and open-ended remarks, the new \"real\" date seems to be August 1. That\u2019s when tariffs are expected to kick in, unless further deals are reached\n\nTrade Deals in the Air: While some agreements with countries like Vietnam and the UK are in the pipeline, much bigger players are still in limbo. How these talks evolve could dictate the next moves in the broader market, particularly for trade-sensitive sectors like tech, manufacturing, and agriculture\n\nRecently, the market's reaction to tariff-related news has been relatively muted. Stocks have been rallying even as uncertainty looms. Could this change be just noise, or is there a deeper market trend taking shape? Despite the tariff chatter, the stock market, especially the U.S. stock market, could continue to gain momentum as traders move past the noise and focus on the fundamentals\n\nLooking at the technical side, we could see sectors like semiconductors, which are heavily influenced by trade relations, experience more volatility. If Trump\u2019s deadline is delayed, we might see some short-term corrections in those areas": 0.2,

  "Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally? - Trump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.\n\nThe Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.\n\nLetters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.\n\nThe timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.\n\nWhat I think the impact will be: \n\nEasing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound \n\nHistorically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.\n\n Possible Dollar Weakness?\n\nIf the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump \u201csoftening his stance\u201d for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.\n\nMy view: \n\nI think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring \u201cover-expectations\u201d), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.\n\nIf the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just \u201cpolitical posturing\u201d without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.\n\nWhat I'm watching: \n\nNVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment \n\n XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports \n\n AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation \n\nWelcome to the discussion: \n\nDo you think this tariff delay is a material positive? Or is it political maneuvering before the election?\n\n Is it a \u201cbull trap\u201d waiting for everyone to get cut during earnings season?": 0.8,

  "Investing In Something You Believe In Rather Than Earnings Sheets.. Thoughts - Prefix, my buddy has been right on a couple of his investments like Tesla. He invests in companies that look cool to him and I think he found them off Cathie Woods.\n\nNow my question, does anyone here invest in a company because it is what you want to become a reality? One example is ACHR. The air transport services with United, Delta, etc along with airports frankly could be overhauled. I want ACHR to, in words, take flight... but I know that the company has unbelievably difficult road ahead with regulations. So much so that I see the possibility of this company ever making profits around 1%.\n\nI told him it would be like gambling, but he is so sure on it.

  "Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn\u2019t say the same things for their net profit.\n\nNet Profit (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million\n\nAfter closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.\n\nAn energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before\u2026 but I believe it\u2019s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company\u2019s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.\n\nRepublicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn\u2019t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!\n\nLet me know what you think, I\u2019m open to all criticism.": 0.5,

  "Evercore: Will boost free cash flow for Microsoft and Oracle - Some software companies, such as Microsoft ( NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Oracle ( NYSE: ORCL ), will benefit from higher free cash flow due to some elements of President Donald Trump's \u2018One Great, Beautiful Act,\u2019 Evercore ISI said.\n\nWe believe \u201cA Great and Beautiful Act\u201d could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,\u2019 said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. \u2018Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.\u2019\n\nEvercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.\n\nMateen said, \"The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .\"\n\nThe bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.\n\nEvercore noted, \u2018The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.\u2019 \"On the capital expenditure side, \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d in the first year.\"\n\nMicrosoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.\n\nEvercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.\n\nAdditionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.": 0.8,

  "My long term stock portfolio strategy (experienced opinions please) - Hey guys, I\u2019m 21 years old and just started building my stock portfolio a few months ago. (I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it\u2019s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.\n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my situation.\n\nI\u2019m fully long-term. I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

  "I don't see MAG7 level growth for Apple - I have a hard time seeing MAG7 level growth for Apple in the mid to long term. Some of my thoughts:\n\n- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view\n\n- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.\n\n- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.\n\nI ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding \"nuanced\" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.\n\nJust wanted to post my thoughts and open to being proven wrong and learning something.

  "This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": 0.5,

  "Energy efficiency and AI growth - I'm new to investing and in that sub so apologies if my discussion is misplaced. I only own a few Nvidia stocks so far. Now that AI has grown leading many semiconductor and AI companies to grow. My thoughts are that energy efficiency for GPUs to run or other solutions will be the next big thing. With data centers popping everywhere energy demands seem to grow significantly. So I'm assuming that either companies with more energy efficient architectures will gain ground or other solutions will need to be brought up. I've done some research on that and I've seen that Ambarella is working on energy efficient chips, Intel is working on neuromorphic but still on r&d level, IBM has some interesting work but it's not focused on that. My thoughts are that energy if not already will very soon be of the essence. So my question/discussion lies on how do you see the AI industry moving forward in relation to energy demands, and if that's to be the case what companies do you think would benefit from such direction.

It seems the entire world needs satellites in the air for web, government, defense, cellular, etc. Again, not familiar with that world but I don't know that I would have much faith if the idea for massive growth was for humans getting to Mars or other Elon-esque grandiose ideas, but it seems there is a giant backlog for people needing / wanting launches for satellites. Is this the main hope? That they figure out reusable rockets and then can constantly be launching satellites? In my early 30s so this would be a long term hold just to have exposure to the sector.

  "Why is the movement in long term (10+ year) treasury yields so muted after the events of the past few days? - The events from the past week should be putting significant upward pressure on long term treasury yields.\n\nTrump's BBB act will add trillions to the already massive US debt. This should increase borrowing costs.\n\nTrump is back to issuing tariff threats to trading partners. This is both inflationary and stifles global trade, which should reduce demand for the US dollar and therefore result in selling pressure on US treasuries.\n\nEconomic data has held up for now. The most recent NFP shows the US is not yet in recession.\n\nTrump is demanding that Powell reduce rates on a daily basis. Rate reductions without a recession should theoretically push down short term yields and push up long term yields due to inflationary pressure.\n\nYet for some reason, 10Y, 20Y, and 30Y treasury yields have barely moved and are actually starting to crawl back down. What could be the reason for this?": -0.8,

  "My Thesis on Hims: Why I Think It\u2019s Worth $34/Share - I spent some time digging into Hims, which has been in the news lately for its spat with Novo Nordisk, the $300B+ Scandinavian pharma company behind Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo accused Hims of deceptive marketing and illegal mass compounding, and the Hims CEO fired back, accusing the pharma giant of being anti-competitive.\n\nNovo pulled the plug, and unsurprisingly, Hims fell 30%.\n\nGeneric medicine reduces healthcare costs, but it\u2019s easy to see why drugmakers that invest heavily in R&D and go through long FDA trials are often at odds with those who can bypass that process entirely.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how this will all shake out or if Novo will drag Hims to court. For now, Hims has found a workaround by offering GLP meds whose active ingredient is liraglutide. Based on what I\u2019ve read, it\u2019s less effective than semaglutide, but Hims keeps the details fuzzy, of course.\n\nAs a company, Hims started off by selling hair loss, anti-anxiety, and sexual health **meds**, before pivoting toward GLP-1s after the FDA allowed compounding pharmacies to step in to cover the shortage. It went public in 2021 at a valuation of just over $1.5B, and over the last four years, its market cap has grown more than 10-fold.\n\nHere are a few things that stood out to me as I was poring through their annual reports:\n\n* The two key revenue drivers are total subscribers and ARPU (Average Revenue Per User). Based on the latest 10-Q, they have 2.36M subscribers and a monthly ARPU of $84.\n* Subscriber growth has slowed: In 2024, Hims acquired \\~57.6K subs/month. In the first three months of Q1 2025, they\u2019ve acquired \\~45.6K per month. I would have expected Q1 to be stronger, given that weight loss tops New Year\u2019s resolutions.\n* ARPU has increased to $84/month. A shift in product mix and price increases are likely contributors.\n* Their biggest cost driver is marketing. Hims spends \\~50% of its revenue on it. All those celebrity endorsements and Super Bowl commercials cost a crap ton of money. They\u2019ve gone from spending $500 to over $1,500 to acquire a new user.\n* Operating margin is a very modest 6.5%.\n* They operate largely in the U.S. but seem to have ambitions to expand globally - Canada, the UK being a start.\n\nHere are my valuation inputs and key assumptions:\n\n* \\~241M shares outstanding (including Class A, Class V, RSUs, and warrants).\n* By the end of 2025, they\u2019ll add 450K new subscribers and generate $2.7B in revenue.\n* Revenue growth will taper from 52% to the risk-free rate over the next 10 years.\n* Telehealth is a low-margin, highly competitive business. Operating margins will improve modestly from \\~6.5% to \\~12% over the next 10 years.\n\nDiscounting it all back and adding cash, I get an equity value of $8B or $33.86/share.\n\nLet me know what you think - would love to hear everyone's thoughts!": 0.2,
