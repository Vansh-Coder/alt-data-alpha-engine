  "The private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, badly missing expectations for a 100,000 increase, ADP says - >Private sector hiring unexpectedly contracted in June, payrolls processing firm ADP said Wednesday, in a possible sign that the economy may not be as sturdy that investors believe as they bid the S&P 500 back up to record territory to end the month.\n\n>Private payrolls lost 33,000 jobs in the June, the ADP report showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast an increase of 100,000 for the month. The May job growth figure was revised even lower to just 29,000 jobs added from 37,000.\n\n>\u201cThough layoffs continue to be rare, a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month,\u201d Nela Richardson, ADP\u2019s chief economist, said in a press release published Wednesday morning.\n\n>To be sure, the ADP report has a spotty track record on predicting the subsequent government jobs report, which investors tend to weigh more heavily. May\u2019s soft ADP data ended up differing significantly from the\u00a0monthly jobs report figures\u00a0that came later in the week.\n\n>This week, the government\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report will be out on Thursday with economists expecting a healthy 110,000 increase for June, per Dow Jones estimates. Economists are expecting the unemployment rate to tick higher to 4.3% from 4.2%. Some economists could revise down their jobs reports estimates following ADP\u2019s data.\n\n>Weekly jobless claims data is also due Thursday, with economists penciling in 240,000. This string of labor stats comes during a shortened trading week, with the market closing early on Thursday and remaining dark on Friday in honor of the July 4 holiday.\n\n>**Service roles hit hardest**\n\n>The bulk of job losses came in service roles tied to professional and business services and health and education, according to the ADP. Professional/business services notched a decline of 56,000, while health/education saw a net loss of 52,000.\n\n>Financial activity roles also contributed to this month\u2019s decline with a drop of 14,000 on balance.\n\n>But the contraction was capped by payroll expansions in goods-producing roles across industries such as manufacturing and mining. All together, goods-producing positions grew by 32,000 in the month, while payrolls for service roles overall fell by 66,000.\n\n>The Midwest and Western U.S. saw the strongest contractions in June, declining by 24,000 and 20,000, respectively. Meanwhile, the Northeast shed 3,000 roles. The Southern U.S. was the sole region tracked by the ADP to see payrolls expand on net in the month, recording an increase of 13,000 positions.\n\n>The smallest firms tended to see more job losses this month than their larger counterparts. In fact, businesses with more than 500 employees saw the biggest payroll growth in the month with an increase of 30,000, per the ADP. By comparison, businesses with fewer than 20 employees accounted for 29,000 lost roles on net.\n\n>Annualized income growth decreased modestly from May for both job stayers and hoppers. The rate of pay increase for those staying in their jobs ticked down to 4.4% from 4.5%, while those getting new roles slid to 6.8% from 7%.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/adp-jobs-report-june-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/adp-jobs-report-june-2025.html)\n\nMy thoughts: Labor data significantly influences Fed policy (of course they might revise this later down the road) which leads to rate changes, market adjusts as a result of those rate changes, and affects volatility as a result, etc etc. So... rate cuts became a lot more likely.": -0.6,

They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.\n\n\n\nThe bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on \u20ac95 billion of American products in response to Trump\u2019s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.\n\n  \nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-04/carmakers-seek-to-offset-tariffs-as-eu-us-trade-talks-near-end?srnd=homepage-americas](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-04/carmakers-seek-to-offset-tariffs-as-eu-us-trade-talks-near-end?srnd=homepage-americas)": 0.1,

  "What stock/investment has been your best decision in your portfolio? - Hi all. As my portfolio expands into new industries, I really wish to diversify. Ive done my research individually and through Vanguard and have been looking for different stocks to move in the direction of. \n\nAs of recent, I bought shares in APH, FIX, and VGK (etf).

  "Planet Labs (PL) will be $50/share soon. Due Diligence - Planet Labs is an AI software and hardware component company for satellites. \n\nWhy the big deal? There is a massive surge in demand on satellites ever since people realized the potential of starlink (starlink has 8000 satellites in orbit alone). Companies and governments are wanting to replicate their own starlink fleets, hence the massive uptick in satellite component manufacturing companies (ASTS/RKLB etc). In the next decade we will see 100s of thousands of satellites being sent to space. \n\nCompany key stats:\n- currently trading at $6.80/share (IPO price $10) \n- US company (Silicon valley tech)\n- 10% YoY revenue growth \n- 2024 revenue = $244Mn\n- Market cap = $2Bn\n\nMajor breakthrough last month with a single contract with the German government for $250Mn, literally equaling their 2024 revenue in a single deal. \n\nPros:\n- relatively unknown company that just surpassed $2Bn MC and has index fund recognition \n- poised in a top growth sector with stable government and big tech contracts\n- potential to have the \"rocket labs, RKLB effect\" and turn into a hit stock\n- huge incoming demand in services\n\nI truly believe this company and stock will become the next ASTS or RKLB in the coming months.

  "sbet ETH Treasury Stock - Recently with crypto gaining momentum. Crypto treasury stocks such as mstr have been top performers. I believe sbet will join this list of top performing crypto treasury companies.\n\nThe difference being that it holds eth. Sbet (SharpLink Gaming) main objective is to get you as much eth per share as possible. When the strategy for acquiring eth was announced the price immediately went from single digits to over 100 dollars per share, and preceded to collapse based on misunderstanding in s3 filing.\n\nContext:\n\nSBET announced a $425 million private placement on May 27, 2025, selling \\~69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to prominent crypto investors, including Consensys, Pantera Capital, and Galaxy Digital. The proceeds were used to acquire 176,270.69 ETH at an average price of $2,626, valued at \\~$462.9 million, positioning SBET as the largest publicly traded Ethereum holder.\n\nHeres my top 8 reasons for v shaped recovery on the ticker back to new highs:\n\n* Misunderstood S-3 Filing and V-Shaped Recovery: The 73% stock crash on June 12, 2025, was due to a misinterpreted S-3 filing mistaken for immediate share dumping, but Joseph Lubin clarified it\u2019s routine, setting SBET up for a quick rebound as seen in its rise to $13.2 by July 3.\n* Massive Ethereum Treasury: SBET\u2019s 198,167 ETH (\\~$528.8 million) makes it a strong Ethereum investment, with potential for big gains if ETH price appreciates.\n* Strong Crypto Backing: Led by Ethereum\u2019s Joseph Lubin (co founder of eth) and backed by Consensys and Pantera Capital, SBET has credible support driving investor interest.\n* Nasdaq Compliance and Resilience: SBET regained Nasdaq compliance, reducing risks, and oversold signals suggest a potential 52% price jump soon.\n* Staking and creative ways to finance eth purchases: Staking yield is one wise strategy for generating more eth per share. Others include selling common stock when stock price is elevated, issuing convertible notes, and def operations for lending or liquidity pools, creating higher yields than holding ETH alone.\n* Round 50% (estimate from coin gecko report) of all stable coins lives on Eth with stable coins growth projected to 10x in the next 5 years. Look at circle and genius act. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent supported this act, and adoption of stable coins. This can be the next catalyst that drives eth price appreciation. (NFTs were major driver for eth in 2021 and has since faded but stable coin adoption is institutional which makes it lot more stable)\n* Institutional adoption of stable coins will spark institutional acquisition of eth to help it stabilize the network.\n* Clean financials.

  "What Would a NAPS Portfolio Look Like in the U.S.? - For those unfamiliar, NAPS stands for No-Admin Portfolio System, and it\u2019s a popular UK-based investing strategy developed by Stockopedia. The idea is simple: create a low-maintenance, rules-based stock portfolio designed to beat the market without constant oversight.\n\n# What is NAPS?\n\nAt its core, NAPS is built using StockRanks, a composite score that ranks stocks based on Quality, Value, and Momentum (QVM). You:\n\n* Select the two highest-ranked stocks in each of the ten major sectors\n* Equal-weight them in the portfolio\n* Hold for one year\n* Rebalance annually based on updated rankings\n\nIt is fully systematic and intentionally avoids subjective decision-making. No news-based trades, no earnings reactions, no macro predictions.\n\n# A Track Record of Outperformance\n\nNAPS has quietly outperformed many professional fund managers and the FTSE All-Share over the past decade in the UK. Its success comes from combining factor-based investing with sector diversification and sticking to it.\n\n# What If You Ran It in the U.S.?\n\nThis got me thinking: what would a U.S.-based NAPS portfolio look like if you applied the same rules to the U.S. stock market? Using something like Stockopedia\u2019s U.S. coverage or a similar QVM screening method (like Portfolio123 or Finbox), you could replicate the structure:\n\n* Ten sectors\n* Two top-ranked stocks per sector\n* Rebalance once a year\n* Set it and forget it\n\nThe question is: which 20 stocks would make the list right now?": 0.5,
  "Could leveraged ETFs make much money on July 9 when Trump's deadline expires and he wants to raise tariffs? Any thoughts would be welcome! - My general thesis is that on July 9, the Stock Market may crash because that's when the foolishness of Trump's trade tariffs will be made clear when his 90 Day Tariffs end on that day. He will not have anything like a clear plan and will not have any countries willing to sign on with him. At that point, the trade-policy gobbledygook will suddenly evaporate and we will have a much clearer view of the the threats to our economy, these including: inflation, rises in cost of living, unemployment, uncertainty and apprehension about the future, etc.\n\nTrump has been making a lot of money for himself and his friends with suddenly raising and lowering tariffs, but he makes money as much of the country loses money.\n\nAlso, he is cheating, breaking the law as he engages in his tariff manipulation and should be punished in some way.\n\nI'd welcome any thoughts on this.

While the administration has touted finalizing agreements soon, trade talks, especially with major partners like the EU, Japan, and India, still seem unresolved\n\nDeadline Shift: Trump\u2019s team previously set a July 9 deadline, but with continued negotiations and open-ended remarks, the new \"real\" date seems to be August 1.

  "Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally? - Trump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.\n\nThe Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.\n\nLetters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.\n\nThe timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.\n\nWhat I think the impact will be: \n\nEasing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound \n\nHistorically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.\n\n Possible Dollar Weakness?\n\nIf the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump \u201csoftening his stance\u201d for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.\n\nMy view: \n\nI think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring \u201cover-expectations\u201d), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.\n\nIf the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just \u201cpolitical posturing\u201d without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.\n\nWhat I'm watching: \n\nNVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment \n\n XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports \n\n AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation \n\nWelcome to the discussion: \n\nDo you think this tariff delay is a material positive?

  "The TACO trade may doom the stock market - Today when Trump announced the 25% tariffs on Japan and Korea, markets had a relatively muted reaction.

Financial markets have begun to largely ignore Trump and his tariffs, pricing in the expectation that he will ultimately chicken out. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Trump always chickens out *because* of the markets reaction.

If the market continues to rally based on bullish sentiment while ignoring the possibility that Trump actually keeps the tariffs this time, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

  "Investing In Something You Believe In Rather Than Earnings Sheets.. Thoughts - Prefix, my buddy has been right on a couple of his investments like Tesla. He invests in companies that look cool to him and I think he found them off Cathie Woods.\n\nNow my question, does anyone here invest in a company because it is what you want to become a reality? One example is ACHR. The air transport services with United, Delta, etc along with airports frankly could be overhauled. I want ACHR to, in words, take flight... but I know that the company has unbelievably difficult road ahead with regulations. So much so that I see the possibility of this company ever making profits around 1%.\n\nI told him it would be like gambling, but he is so sure on it. Does anyone else think about using some of their money for companies that have great ideas, but that might be all they are?": 0.2,
  "Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn\u2019t say the same things for their net profit.\n\nNet Profit (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million\n\nAfter closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.\n\nAn energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before\u2026 but I believe it\u2019s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company\u2019s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.\n\nRepublicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn\u2019t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!\n\nLet me know what you think, I\u2019m open to all criticism.": 0.6,

  "Evercore: Will boost free cash flow for Microsoft and Oracle - Some software companies, such as Microsoft ( NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Oracle ( NYSE: ORCL ), will benefit from higher free cash flow due to some elements of President Donald Trump's \u2018One Great, Beautiful Act,\u2019 Evercore ISI said.\n\nWe believe \u201cA Great and Beautiful Act\u201d could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,\u2019 said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. \u2018Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.\u2019\n\nEvercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.\n\nMateen said, \"The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .\"\n\nThe bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.\n\nEvercore noted, \u2018The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.\u2019 \"On the capital expenditure side, \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d in the first year.\"\n\nMicrosoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.\n\nEvercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.\n\nAdditionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.": 0.8,

  "My long term stock portfolio strategy (experienced opinions please) - Hey guys, I\u2019m 21 years old and just started building my stock portfolio a few months ago. (I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it\u2019s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.\n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my situation.\n\nI\u2019m fully long-term. I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.
