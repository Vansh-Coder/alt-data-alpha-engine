2025-07-03 19:27:35+00:00,NOW,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Trump’s Tax Bill Ekes Through House. The President Meets His Deadline. - President Donald Trump and Republicans will hit their July 4 deadline to pass the president’s signature tax and spending legislation and sign it into law. Now the pressure will be on to convince voters that Trump’s achievement will make the U.S. economy stronger. Americans thus far aren’t convinced.

The House voted 218-214 to pass the bill, which extends the individual tax cuts that Trump originally signed into law in 2017, among other provisions.

Over the past two days, fiscal conservatives have lambasted the bill for adding a projected $3.4 trillion to the $36.2 trillion national debt over the next decade. Meanwhile, some GOP moderates expressed concern about the bill’s cuts to Medicaid that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said will likely result in nearly 12 million people losing their insurance coverage.

In the end, both groups folded without any changes. Some previous holdouts said the White House made assurances on how they would enforce certain provisions in the bill, while House leadership also suggested Republicans would have a chance to pass another bill to make changes later in the year.

Corporate America gets a sigh of relief for expansion and new investment allowed by the increased revenue and liquidity.  Many small businesses will benefit as well, which will funnel additional funding to the large corporations.**

* This makes the dropped corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% permanent and lowers marginal income tax rates for most tax brackets.
* Rejection of increase in stock buyback tax.
* Rejection of proposed tax bills that would have limited state and local deductions for corporations.
* The new tax bill is set to benefit private student loan lenders, such as SoFi, which could see a jump in demand.
* Many of the tax breaks from the 2017 TCJA (originally set to expire in 2025) will become permanent.
* Restore a tax break from the 2017 tax package that allowed businesses to fully write off the cost of equipment in the first year it was purchased
* Allow businesses to write off the cost of research and development in the year it was incurred
* Businesses will be allowed to fully and immediately deduct the cost of building new manufacturing facilities.
* QBI for Small Businesses and Partnerships (formed by lawyers, doctors, and investors) will increase through the House Proposal from 20% to 23% from now until 2029. The Senate bill will permanently maintain the current minimum 20% rate.

* \~$10B in funding to reach the Moon and Mars, and decommission of the ISS.

**Here are other Winners and Losers of the new tax bill:**

**Winners:**

Millionaires' inheritance beneficiaries: The estate tax exemption rises to $15 million for individuals, $30 million for married couples, and then adjusts with inflation.

State and local tax deduction rises to $40,000 annually for a five-year period, which phases out for earners over $500,000/year.

Seniors get a larger standard deduction.

Tips and Overtime pay are exempt from income taxes.

529 Plan benefits for younger children went up from $10K to $20K in annual withdrawals while widening the definition of “qualified expenses” in K-12 to include non-tuition categories like books, tutoring, standardized testing fees, educational therapies for children with disabilities, and more.  Increasing the ability to pay for private school, along with public school-type expenses.

Certain professional credential fees, like exams and licensing costs, will also now be covered as qualified expenses under 529 Plan funds.

A new tax-advantaged investment vehicle named the Trump Account (basically a Kid IRA), which has to be established before children turn 18 and can’t be tapped until after they turn 18.  However, 529s remain optimal for those looking to save for educational expenses.

Private Equity tax breaks.

Domestic Car Buyers would get up to $10,000 a year in loan interest deduction through 2028.

Fossil Fuel Producers get tax breaks.

Telecommunications get a massive, wider radio spectrum, increasing service capabilities

**Losers:**

New work requirements for Medicaid recipients with cuts and increased cost sharing.

Expanded work requirements for food stamps to cover beneficiaries up to 65 YO with states to contribute portions of food stamp benefits.

Tax credits for solar panels and wind systems are phasing out.

Tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements are eliminated at the end of the year.

EV maker hit by elimination of $7,500 tax credit.

Elite universities get new tiered tax rates as high as 8%.

New 1% tax on transfers of money to foreign countries.  (This is currently tackled by companies such as SoFi with the development of International money transfer utilizing blockchain and Crypto international payment with SoFi/Galileo)

Restrictions on some immigrants' access to health coverage premium credits.

Gamblers would be limited to a 90% deduction on losses against their winnings.",

2025-07-04 15:46:28+00:00,SO,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Carmakers Seek to Offset Tariffs as EU-US Trade Talks Near End - Some European Union carmakers and capitals are pushing for an agreement with President Donald Trump that would allow for tariff relief in return for increasing investments in the US, according to people familiar with the matter.



Member states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.



The EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc’s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.



US and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.



Any deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.



The commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.



The people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they’re prepared to accept in any deal.



Some capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don’t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump’s levies with countermeasures.



The bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.



“We want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. “We will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.”



The EU has approved tariffs on €21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump’s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.



The bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on €95 billion of American products in response to Trump’s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.

2025-07-04 23:27:17+00:00,NOW,reddit.com/r/stocks,"What stock/investment has been your best decision in your portfolio? - Hi all. As my portfolio expands into new industries, I really wish to diversify. Ive done my research individually and through Vanguard and have been looking for different stocks to move in the direction of. 

As of recent, I bought shares in APH, FIX, and VGK (etf). This was after a bit of research and advice. I went for VGK as it is very very slow but seems to be consistent enough to where im willing to invest a bit in it (also due to a hint of hesitancy in the American market). 

My question arrives as I get older and I feel like im entering the best years of my life to invest. My best stock, far none, has been Costco. Ive continually invested in Cosco from when it was around 180 or so a share. Without a doubt, it has been my best share. Partially due to luck but also research from when I was younger. 

Nevertheless, with an uncertain market in the states, I worry about keeping my portfolio to where it is right now (in which I am in afew industries with VTI and VGK as my two etfs and around 14 individual stocks in a decent arrange of industries). The main being Industrials and health care. In which I would like to expand to a more agricultural side of things and more industrial planning. 

So, I do ask, which stock has been your best far for your portfolio?",

2025-07-05 14:30:38+00:00,SO,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Relatives don’t want to invest because “they don’t have the money to do all that trading” - I’m in my 40’s and investing has benefited me over the years.  No matter how good stocks have been to me, there are always people and relatives that are a combination of risk averse and ignorant to investing.

I used to get into these conversations more but not so often anymore.  

How can we get the “I don’t have thousands to put in” and the “what if I lose it all” people to start investing.

My fiancée now has 10’s of thousands of dollars invested and very happy with her acct, but I literally had to make her open up the laptop and open an acct.

My rebuttal to “I don’t have thousands to put in” was let’s put in $1 today.  It’s like doing 1 pushup.  You never get in shape if you don’t at least start.

My rebuttal to “what if I lose it all, it took me x number of years to save up x $$” was let’s start with a company you know for sure will still be around in 10 years because you personally spend your money there.

Even $10 a week turns into hundreds of thousands of dollars over decades.

How can we encourage people to actually invest?",

2025-07-05 17:02:40+00:00,COST,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Waymo's moat is overrated. AVs will become a commodity not a winner take all - There’s a popular view that Waymo will dominate AVs like Google did with search. But that oversimplifies how transport, hardware, and regulation actually work. AVs likely won’t be winner-take-all. More likely, autonomy becomes a commodity layer like smartphone OS or GPS chips where value shifts to branding, logistics, and vertical integration.

Even if Waymo has the best tech, that doesn’t guarantee market control. Car makers can build or license AV systems. Delivery and ride-share players  may care more about cost and scale than whose software is inside.

Once the tech stabilizes, margins shrink and the real competition moves up the stack. What do you think is the market overrating Waymo’s moat? Or is AV dominance still on the table?",
2025-07-05 20:52:51+00:00,NOW,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Need Advice, Screwed Up - My portfolio was doing great pre-liberation day and was up very big however it was all in risky, very speculative stocks. When liberation day came, I panicked and sold off everything. I would’ve held had I been in standard Index funds, but my risky positions scared me as I didn’t know if these speculative plays would ever come back. Now here I am, down 15% YTD and depressed. Lots of lessons learned. 

Moving on from this I want to get back to the typical boglehead portfolio, while keeping maybe 5-10% for individual plays. However, I’m afraid about entering now at ATHs. How do you recommend I get back in to the market. Should I DCA, lump sum, or wait it out a few months? My retirement age is still 30+ years away thankfully. ",
2025-07-06 01:33:43+00:00,NOW,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Well, the real economy will end up tagging the market, but when and how? - Despite the recent resilience, the US stock market will likely stumble at some point when it get tired to reach new highs. Many, including me, initially thought the economy would crash faster after tariffs, but instead a deep slowdown is hitting per some comments on my previous post; therefore, I dare to rethink. 

Possible  that real unemployment numbers are worse than what appears on the surface. Oil prices were expected to significantly soar during the short US/Israel vs Iran conflict, but they spiked far lower than anyone thought for now, may be to test some resistance and to adjust to the recent Opec cartel production boost. Tesla was expected to crash, holding and dancing for now with better than expected Q2 sales in light of brand damage, but brand damage is incurable, and it seems that Elon no longer care. He is creating a party. So we will eventually get there, Tesla back to the low $100, but when? Robotaxi sales are not going to be spectacular 

The “big beautiful bill” passed easily, but maybe that was always a sure thing. The real story here is “nothing surprising,”  for the market for now. It was priced in at some like to say. The stock market is led by the “Magnificent 7” only on surface and positively impact market beta. Will AI efficiency fill the void of expected job losses and citizen income erosion?

We’re at a turning point: geopolitics and its great games are shedding light on new priorities , AI progress is exponentially disruptive, democratic institutions are eroding and tech billionaire are trying to rewrite the rules, buying lieutenant colonel titles:  Palantir, an obscure company, and I wish I know what they do exactly.

The real economy still decides what happens in the end.

There’s no reliable seasonality pattern for now: stocks don’t always follow predictable patterns. but the index does go up and it does go down..most think that it is 1989 or 2008..real question is when?

The tax breaks from the “big beautiful bill” will help billionaires  to buy more ownership , but if the dollar is decreasing, how to benefit from that or which countries will lose the most and which one will gain the most?

I have no money left to buy any dips if I want, and no balls left to short the market when needed. I am in torpor, mouth wide open..

2025-07-06 22:02:47+00:00,NOW,reddit.com/r/stocks,"What Would a NAPS Portfolio Look Like in the U.S.? - For those unfamiliar, NAPS stands for No-Admin Portfolio System, and it’s a popular UK-based investing strategy developed by Stockopedia. The idea is simple: create a low-maintenance, rules-based stock portfolio designed to beat the market without constant oversight.

# What is NAPS?

At its core, NAPS is built using StockRanks, a composite score that ranks stocks based on Quality, Value, and Momentum (QVM). You:

* Select the two highest-ranked stocks in each of the ten major sectors
* Equal-weight them in the portfolio
* Hold for one year
* Rebalance annually based on updated rankings

It is fully systematic and intentionally avoids subjective decision-making. No news-based trades, no earnings reactions, no macro predictions.

# A Track Record of Outperformance

NAPS has quietly outperformed many professional fund managers and the FTSE All-Share over the past decade in the UK. Its success comes from combining factor-based investing with sector diversification and sticking to it.

# What If You Ran It in the U.S.?

This got me thinking: what would a U.S.-based NAPS portfolio look like if you applied the same rules to the U.S. stock market? Using something like Stockopedia’s U.S. coverage or a similar QVM screening method (like Portfolio123 or Finbox), you could replicate the structure:

* Ten sectors
* Two top-ranked stocks per sector
* Rebalance once a year
* Set it and forget it

The question is: which 20 stocks would make the list right now?",
2025-07-06 22:21:10+00:00,COST,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Could leveraged ETFs make much money on July 9 when Trump's deadline expires and he wants to raise tariffs? Any thoughts would be welcome! - My general thesis is that on July 9, the Stock Market may crash because that's when the foolishness of Trump's trade tariffs will be made clear when his 90 Day Tariffs end on that day. He will not have anything like a clear plan and will not have any countries willing to sign on with him. At that point, the trade-policy gobbledygook will suddenly evaporate and we will have a much clearer view of the the threats to our economy, these including: inflation, rises in cost of living, unemployment, uncertainty and apprehension about the future, etc.

Trump has been making a lot of money for himself and his friends with suddenly raising and lowering tariffs, but he makes money as much of the country loses money.

Also, he is cheating, breaking the law as he engages in his tariff manipulation and should be punished in some way.

I'd welcome any thoughts on this. Thanks!",

Futures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), the S&P 500 (ES=F), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) all dropped around 0.3%.

Trump had targeted July 9 as a self-imposed deadline, when his ""pause"" on steep April tariffs would go back into effect. Global markets have been bracing for that potential shock, with the US only having reached deals with the UK and Vietnam, as well as a framework toward an agreement with China.

But on Sunday, both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump suggested that while Trump could send out letters this week informing countries of their tariff rates, those duties would not go into effect until Aug. 1.

""President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on Aug. 1 you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,"" Bessent told CNN's ""State of Union.""

AAPL, DDOG, BGM, MDB, TEAM, and OKTA could benefit if progress on trade deals helps stabilize sentiment and supports a rebound in both large-cap tech and mid-cap growth names.

Bessent hinted at several possible deals in the coming days, suggesting the focus this week is clarity with 18 major trading partners before setting duties for the 100-plus other countries that the administration has in its sights for trade taxation. Wall Street is waiting to see how trade talks between the European Union and Canada go, in addition to other key partners.",

2025-07-07 14:27:55+00:00,TEAM,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Trump’s July Tariff Deadline Likely Pushed to August  How Will It Impact Markets? - The anticipation surrounding President Trump's tariff deadline for July 9 seems to be slipping into August, and potentially even beyond, with the latest updates suggesting a more extended timeline for these trade talks. While the administration has touted finalizing agreements soon, trade talks, especially with major partners like the EU, Japan, and India, still seem unresolved

Deadline Shift: Trump’s team previously set a July 9 deadline, but with continued negotiations and open-ended remarks, the new ""real"" date seems to be August 1. That’s when tariffs are expected to kick in, unless further deals are reached

Trade Deals in the Air: While some agreements with countries like Vietnam and the UK are in the pipeline, much bigger players are still in limbo. How these talks evolve could dictate the next moves in the broader market, particularly for trade-sensitive sectors like tech, manufacturing, and agriculture

Recently, the market's reaction to tariff-related news has been relatively muted. Stocks have been rallying even as uncertainty looms. Could this change be just noise, or is there a deeper market trend taking shape? Despite the tariff chatter, the stock market, especially the U.S. stock market, could continue to gain momentum as traders move past the noise and focus on the fundamentals

Looking at the technical side, we could see sectors like semiconductors, which are heavily influenced by trade relations, experience more volatility. If Trump’s deadline is delayed, we might see some short-term corrections in those areas",
2025-07-07 14:42:37+00:00,GILD,reddit.com/r/stocks,"What do yall think about these tickers as ideas for 3-6 month longs? - Hey! I’m 20 years old started learning finance and stock market a few months ago, also starting to build my own trading porfolio and I will be mostly focusing on options however now I can’t trade options and I’m looking to just “invest” or basically get some sort of a yield to up my balance slowly.
From what I see now we’re in the recession phase of the financial cycle, and I know that in recession we’ll usually go for defensive sectors like health or consumer staples, I’ve gathered some tickers from the health sector that are performing better than the rest of the stocks in that sector and put them in my watch list.

Also I did take some of the better tech tickers, in case they still go up I’ll go long on them and maybe hedge by shorting on the tech sector by taking a short on a ETF of the tech sector. (Because tech sector usually performs less in recession).

Also started looking into the aerospace sector/industry which performs pretty good and has higher estimated growth and sales for the future than most of the sectors 

Although we’re still in a situation where the NDQ and SP500 and the whole market is still “warm” inflation is high and key indicators are indicating that we’re going into recession, and also there’s the geopolitical situations and tarrfis..

2025-07-07 18:16:28+00:00,AMZN,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally? - Trump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.

The Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.

Letters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.

The timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.

What I think the impact will be: 

Easing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound 

Historically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.

 Possible Dollar Weakness?

If the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump “softening his stance” for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.

My view: 

I think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring “over-expectations”), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.

If the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just “political posturing” without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.

What I'm watching: 

NVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment 

 XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports 

 AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation 

Welcome to the discussion: 

Do you think this tariff delay is a material positive? Or is it political maneuvering before the election?

 Is it a “bull trap” waiting for everyone to get cut during earnings season?",

**U.S. dollar still holds strong as the world’s reserve currency**

**U.S. Big Tech continues to lead in global innovation and profits.**

**The 401(k) retirement system funnels massive capital into the index, creating steady demand.**

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Now my question, does anyone here invest in a company because it is what you want to become a reality? One example is ACHR. The air transport services with United, Delta, etc along with airports frankly could be overhauled. I want ACHR to, in words, take flight... but I know that the company has unbelievably difficult road ahead with regulations. So much so that I see the possibility of this company ever making profits around 1%.

I told him it would be like gambling, but he is so sure on it. Does anyone else think about using some of their money for companies that have great ideas, but that might be all they are?",

2025-07-08 12:27:41+00:00,SO,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I’ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

Operating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)

2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million

2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million

2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million

2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

Net Profit (since becoming an IPP)

2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million

2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million

2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

Let me know what you think, I’m open to all criticism. ",

We believe “A Great and Beautiful Act” could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,’ said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. ‘Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.’

Evercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.

Mateen said, ""The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .""

The bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.

Evercore noted, ‘The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.’ ""On the capital expenditure side, “bonus depreciation” on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent “bonus depreciation” in the first year.""

Microsoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.

Evercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.

Additionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.",

2025-07-08 16:40:34+00:00,NOW,reddit.com/r/stocks,"My long term stock portfolio strategy (experienced opinions please) - Hey guys, I’m 21 years old and just started building my stock portfolio a few months ago. (I’m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

Would love to hear your thoughts. I’m still new to all this and just trying to learn.",

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

U.S. Comex copper futures jumped more than 10% after the announcement.


Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

The Trump administration announced a so-called Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports of the red metal in February. The deadline for the investigation to conclude is in November.

The National Mining Association and the American Critical Minerals Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer, did not immediately respond to request for comment.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Just wanted to post my thoughts and open to being proven wrong and learning something. Cheers",

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

I only own a few Nvidia stocks so far. Now that AI has grown leading many semiconductor and AI companies to grow. My thoughts are that energy efficiency for GPUs to run or other solutions will be the next big thing. With data centers popping everywhere energy demands seem to grow significantly. So I'm assuming that either companies with more energy efficient architectures will gain ground or other solutions will need to be brought up. I've done some research on that and I've seen that Ambarella is working on energy efficient chips, Intel is working on neuromorphic but still on r&d level, IBM has some interesting work but it's not focused on that. My thoughts are that energy if not already will very soon be of the essence. So my question/discussion lies on how do you see the AI industry moving forward in relation to energy demands, and if that's to be the case what companies do you think would benefit from such direction.

Wanting some exposure to Space stocks but am trying to hear people's reasoning for investing in something like Rocket Labs (shocker lol). Read a good deal about the company but then tried to understand where their revenue comes from and the potential growth there. It seems the entire world needs satellites in the air for web, government, defense, cellular, etc. Again, not familiar with that world but I don't know that I would have much faith if the idea for massive growth was for humans getting to Mars or other Elon-esque grandiose ideas, but it seems there is a giant backlog for people needing / wanting launches for satellites. Is this the main hope? That they figure out reusable rockets and then can constantly be launching satellites? In my early 30s so this would be a long term hold just to have exposure to the sector. Would love to hear from anyone who is well versed or passionate about what the future could hold for financials in these companies competing in the space race. ",

The chipmaker is the first company to ever achieve this market value.

Nvidia is the world’s most valuable company, surpassing Microsoft and Apple, both of which hit the $3 trillion mark before Nvidia. Microsoft is also one of Nvidia’s biggest and most important customers.

The California-based company, which was founded in 1993, first passed the $2 trillion mark in February 2024, and surpassed $3 trillion in June.

Nvidia has profited heavily off of growing demand for artificial intelligence hardware and chips since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. The company has positioned itself as the decisive leader in the creating the graphics processing units that power large language models.

2025-07-09 14:52:49+00:00,SO,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Digital Ocean? - I’ve been investing for a little over a year. I’ve learned a ton, I still have a lot to learn. This “new age” stock market is so hard to understand. Dozens of unprofitable companies trading at 30x p/s ratios or higher. Yet a company that’s actually profitable, and trading at a reasonable p/s goes nowhere’s in any meaningful way. I’m trying to make good value decisions but I feel like I should be trading on hype rather than financials. 


Lowered outlook, but still, they are profitable. 
I found this company while researching soundhound. Hesitant to get in because 1. It’s unprofitable. 2. It’s trading at an extremely high p/s. But of course that company will go up 30% in 4 days.

Someone teach me something. TIA!

Trump's BBB act will add trillions to the already massive US debt. This should increase borrowing costs.

Trump is back to issuing tariff threats to trading partners. This is both inflationary and stifles global trade, which should reduce demand for the US dollar and therefore result in selling pressure on US treasuries.

Economic data has held up for now. The most recent NFP shows the US is not yet in recession.

Trump is demanding that Powell reduce rates on a daily basis. Rate reductions without a recession should theoretically push down short term yields and push up long term yields due to inflationary pressure.

Yet for some reason, 10Y, 20Y, and 30Y treasury yields have barely moved and are actually starting to crawl back down. What could be the reason for this?",

2025-07-09 20:44:50+00:00,NOW,reddit.com/r/stocks,"My Thesis on Hims: Why I Think It’s Worth $34/Share - I spent some time digging into Hims, which has been in the news lately for its spat with Novo Nordisk, the $300B+ Scandinavian pharma company behind Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo accused Hims of deceptive marketing and illegal mass compounding, and the Hims CEO fired back, accusing the pharma giant of being anti-competitive.

Novo pulled the plug, and unsurprisingly, Hims fell 30%.

Generic medicine reduces healthcare costs, but it’s easy to see why drugmakers that invest heavily in R&D and go through long FDA trials are often at odds with those who can bypass that process entirely.

I’m not sure how this will all shake out or if Novo will drag Hims to court. For now, Hims has found a workaround by offering GLP meds whose active ingredient is liraglutide. Based on what I’ve read, it’s less effective than semaglutide, but Hims keeps the details fuzzy, of course.

As a company, Hims started off by selling hair loss, anti-anxiety, and sexual health **meds**, before pivoting toward GLP-1s after the FDA allowed compounding pharmacies to step in to cover the shortage. It went public in 2021 at a valuation of just over $1.5B, and over the last four years, its market cap has grown more than 10-fold.

Here are a few things that stood out to me as I was poring through their annual reports:

* The two key revenue drivers are total subscribers and ARPU (Average Revenue Per User). Based on the latest 10-Q, they have 2.36M subscribers and a monthly ARPU of $84.
* Subscriber growth has slowed: In 2024, Hims acquired \~57.6K subs/month. In the first three months of Q1 2025, they’ve acquired \~45.6K per month. I would have expected Q1 to be stronger, given that weight loss tops New Year’s resolutions.
* ARPU has increased to $84/month. A shift in product mix and price increases are likely contributors.
* Their biggest cost driver is marketing. Hims spends \~50% of its revenue on it. All those celebrity endorsements and Super Bowl commercials cost a crap ton of money. They’ve gone from spending $500 to over $1,500 to acquire a new user.
* Operating margin is a very modest 6.5%.
* They operate largely in the U.S. but seem to have ambitions to expand globally - Canada, the UK being a start.

Here are my valuation inputs and key assumptions:

* \~241M shares outstanding (including Class A, Class V, RSUs, and warrants).
* By the end of 2025, they’ll add 450K new subscribers and generate $2.7B in revenue.
* Revenue growth will taper from 52% to the risk-free rate over the next 10 years.
* Telehealth is a low-margin, highly competitive business. Operating margins will improve modestly from \~6.5% to \~12% over the next 10 years.

Discounting it all back and adding cash, I get an equity value of $8B or $33.86/share.

Let me know what you think - would love to hear everyone's thoughts!",
