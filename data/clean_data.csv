But honestly, what really sets them apart is who’s buying from them. When the top five richest companies on Earth  AMZN, GOOG, META, MSFT, even TSLA  are all basically funneling their AI capex directly into Nvidia’s pockets, you realize this isn’t just about good tech. It’s about having the best seat at the table

$4 trillion market cap. That’s not just hype anymore. It’s the result of every major tech platform building AI data centers on top of Nvidia’s ecosystem. Even if their AI tools flop or adoption slows, Nvidia already got paid. Meanwhile, the Apples, Metas, Googles of the world still need to convince us that the AI tools are worth using

And yeah, sure  competition is coming. AMD, Intel, startups like Groq or Cerebras… But Nvidia’s lead isn’t just in chips. It’s in software (CUDA), developer loyalty, global reach, and sheer momentum

At this point, they’re not just selling chips. They’re selling shovels during a gold rush  and the miners are billion-dollar tech giants with no choice but to buy in

I’m not saying there’s no risk. If AI turns out to be overhyped, or if capex cools off, Nvidia could feel it. But so far, every quarterly report just reinforces the same message: the AI boom may be messy, but Nvidia wins either way

They’re making money before anyone else does while everyone’s still figuring out how to monetize AI, Nvidia is just cashing checks",
2025-07-10 13:13:28+00:00,COST,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Trump Just Dropped The 50% ‘Copper Tariff Bomb’ - What Does This Mean For The Stock Market? - That's right ...Trump just announced that he will impose a 50% tariff on copper, effective August 1, 2025, citing a “national security assessment.”

In his statement, he bombastically emphasized the importance of copper to the country: copper is the second most used material in the Department of Defense. How can we let ‘sleepy leaders’ destroy this industry? It's time to rebuild America's copper industry. This is our golden age!

What this means for the market (personal opinion): Copper prices could be about to spike (again) Copper (HG=F) has bounced around $4.50/lb last week. Once the tariffs hit the ground, expect importers to stock up ahead of time and copper mining stocks to put in a rally. Focus: Freeport-McMoRan ($FCX), Southern Copper ($SCCO), Teck ($TECK), as well as small-caps Taseko ($TGB), Copper Mountain ($CPPMF).

Risk of rising short-term inflationary pressures 

Copper is widely used in construction, data centers, electric vehicles, power grids, and defense.

50% tariffs = higher costs = could push up cost transmission effects in industrial and tech supply chains.

New energy, EV sectors could be under pressure 

Tesla ($TSLA), Enphase ($ENPH), Azure ($NIO), etc. could face higher raw material costs.

Energy storage and battery businesses will have their margins squeezed if they haven't hedged copper prices in advance.

Defense contractors may be forced to strain 

RTX, LMT, NOC, and others rely on copper for radar, missile, and flight systems.

With tariffs raising domestic copper prices, these companies may either lobby the government or turn to local supply chains.

My personal view: 

Short term? Bullish on copper mining stocks, bearish on rising manufacturing costs 

Medium term? Watch inflation and Fed policy feedback 

Long term? This is clearly a big election year move, with lots of policy variables and no shortage of volatility

Incidentally: if copper prices continue to rise, it may be harder for the Fed to cut rates as a result - a potential impact variable for the stock market as a whole.

Would also like to hear your thoughts: 

Do you think this is a pre-election bluff? Or will Congress really follow through?

Has anyone started laying out copper futures or options yet?

Is this just short term volatility or the beginning of a major style switch in industrial stocks? Not investment advice. Just a guy who stares at copper futures every day like it's an EKG.",

2025-07-10 14:34:10+00:00,RTX,reddit.com/r/stocks,"NVDA In-Depth Discussion Post: why do AI giants continue to strengthen? Up or down? My view at the end. - Latest data and market performance 

As of today, Nvidia shares are trading at $162.44, with an intraday high of $164.71 (hitting the $4T market cap threshold), a slight intraday pullback, but generally stable, and up over 40% over the past three months, with a cumulative gain of \~20% since 2025 - a wave largely driven by the AI boom!

AI Demand Rampage: Blackwell Sovereign AI 

Blackwell architecture chips (including GB200 datacenter products and RTX 50 series) continue to drive datacenter and high-end gaming markets, with high demand through 2024-25 

Sovereign AI ""Wave: Citi raises target price to 190, focusing on strong growth in demand for government-grade AI deployments, AI data center market expected to grow to $563B by 2028

NVDA financial performance: far exceeded expectations 

Q1 2025 revenue reached $44.06B, up 69% y/y; of which data center revenue was $39.1B, up 73% y/y. ytd stock price rose 21%, more than triple in 3 years, the market is optimistic about continued expansion in the next 2 years.

Pullback pressure and potential risks: export restrictions impact: up to $8B of China sales are restricted, short-term profits and revenue there is a non-negligible disturbance 

valuation height: although a number of institutions still maintain a Strong Buy, the target price is mainly concentrated in the $174-$190 range, the potential upside space is limited.

Competition and macro uncertainty: AMD, Broadcom and other rivals continue to force, and the global economy, interest rates and policy may become uncertain launch factors.

My short-term technical outlook and market observation 

If the US market pulls back due to macro risks, NVDA will also be under short-term retracement pressure.

Resistance: $164.7-165 range highs are key, breakout could trigger a rally to $175-190. 

Support: $155-160. If broken, be wary of technical corrective pressure.

My view 

Long term holders: 

NVDA has AI “No. 1” status, architecture + chip + software ecosystem is mature, government and enterprise AI continues to expand, valuation is high but the next 3 years there is still a lot of room for growth.

Short-term traders: 

current position between resistance and support, high valuation stage, if touch export restrictions or macro negative, or 5-10% retracement opportunities. If it breaks $165, short-term follow-through long can be considered.

Conclusion Summary: 

Supporting factors: Blackwell chip architecture, AI demand continues to explode, government programs pushing Sovereign AI levels up, strong earnings.

Risk factors: export ban, valuation near record highs, increased competition, macroeconomic uncertainty.

What do you think?

Is the global government embrace of AI a bubble or a trend?

Will NVDA correct again in the short term? At what price would you take a position?

If Trump's policies tighten or the global economy weakens, how big of a hit will it be for NVDA?",

AMD is gaining ground in accelerating revenue growth compared to competitors such as Intel and NVIDIA Additionally AMD's expected 2025 price-to-earnings ratio of 37.09 looks overvalued But extending the timeline to 2026 that P/E would fall to 25 16 which is more palatable especially for a company with high double-digit revenue and earnings growth. In contrast, NVIDIA's P/E ratio is typically much higher at similar growth rates So while retrospective metrics suggest AMD is overvalued, forward-looking forecasts suggest the opposite If the company performs as expected and capitalizes on its strong momentum in AI servers and semi-custom businesses, then today's price could very well be tomorrow's bargain",

>The broadside by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought opened up a new front in Trump’s war of words against Powell.

They're trying to set the stage to fire Powell. **The Supreme Court ruling was only surrounding reasons other than malfeasance or misconduct.** So this would give them an avenue to eject Powell now, because they could cite misleading Congress about the renovation cost as misconduct.

What do we think the broader market implications will be? And who will they pick to replace Powell?",

2025-07-10 21:37:47+00:00,NOW,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Tesla moves to expand Robotaxi to Phoenix, following rival Waymo - Elon Musk’s Tesla has applied to test and eventually deploy its Robotaxi vehicles in Phoenix, Arizona, following in the footsteps of market leader Waymo.

Tesla has applied to conduct autonomous vehicle testing and operations, with and without human safety drivers on board, in Arizona, a spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Transportation told CNBC on Thursday. A decision on the application is expected at the end of July, and Tesla has “expressed interest in operating within the Phoenix Metro area,” the spokesperson said via email.

Reuters first reported Tesla’s Arizona ambitions.

The effort to expand to Arizona comes after Tesla in June began a pilot test of its robotaxis in Austin, Texas. Tesla’s Austin fleet includes Model Y SUVs that are equipped with the company’s newest, automated driving systems. Those vehicles are remotely supervised by employees in an undisclosed operations center, and they each include a human safety supervisor who rides with passengers.

The safety supervisor sits in the front passenger seat, accompanying riders, who are invited fans of Tesla. The supervisor can intervene should the Tesla Robotaxis get into trouble.

Waymo, owned by Google parent Alphabet, opened up a driverless robotaxi service to the public in the Phoenix area in 2020.

Tesla, which was once seen as a self-driving pioneer, is now working to catch up to Waymo. The companies have distinct approaches to self-driving technology. Tesla claims its choice to mostly use cameras instead of expensive sensors like lidar will make its autonomous vehicles more economically viable.

The Musk company’s initial efforts in Austin have run into issues.

One invited passenger, who runs a Tesla-focused YouTube channel called Dirty Tesla, captured an incident on camera where his Robotaxi dinged a parked car outside of a restaurant.

Other incidents where Tesla Robotaxis violated rules of the road in Austin have also been captured on camera and circulated on social media, drawing regulatory scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal vehicle safety agency.

Tesla is scheduled to hold a second-quarter earnings call on July 23, during which executives are expected to discuss the initial Robotaxi pilot.

Separately, Musk on Wednesday said on X that Tesla’s Robotaxi service will expand to the San Francisco Bay Area “probably in a month or two.”

The California Department of Motor Vehicles sued Tesla in 2022 alleging that the company made false claims in marketing and advertising about its vehicles’ self-driving capabilities.

To me it appears that they offered an IPO at .65 USD per share w/ a 5 year warrant.  My understanding is that this warrant can be exercised immediately so if the stock went to $1.00 the buyer could exercise that warrant for a stock correct?   As luck would have it, I already had about 1,500 shares of this company when this IPO went public and it tanked from .96 USD to .49 USD.  From my research, this company has a ton of upside (Which is why i own it).  I then purchased about 12K more shares when it was at .49.  it has since recovered to .67 but my question is about the future value and how someone could have gotten into this IPO.   
  
I see a ticker of E8LA mentioned but I have no idea how I could have even gotten into this IPO if i even wanted to.  Currently, it has benefitted me in not doing so but I'm curious about how these work and how they impact future value.  The value of the stock at the time of this IPO was .96 as mentioned so was the company not expecting it to tank as much as it did (And thus screwing existing share holders) or hoping that that undervalued IPO would entice a bunch of buyers and thus capital and the value would quickly recover?  Why would the stock ever get much above their warrant value of .65 with shareholders knowing that there is/was a set value some could purchase it at in the event it rose. and thus creating dilution for existing shareholders.  It makes me almost want to take the gains I got buying a ton at .49. Maybe my thought process on this is entirely wrong (Quite likely) 

Thanks much,

  
Dave

2025-07-11 02:17:56+00:00,SO,reddit.com/r/stocks,"50 percent tarifs on copper and 35 percent tariffs on Canada will suffocate US manufacturers - Global copper demand keeps rising because copper is essential for construction, electrical wiring, renewable energy, and electric vehicles. Many forecasts expect demand to double by 2035 as clean energy and electrification expand.

The supply chain begins with mining in countries like Chile, Peru, China, the DRC, the U.S., and Canada. Companies like Freeport-McMoRan, Southern Copper, BHP, Rio Tinto, First Quantum Minerals, and Teck Resources handle large-scale mining. The ore is processed, smelted, refined into copper cathodes, and then fabricated into rods, wires, pipes, and sheets. These products feed industries from housing to power grids and EVs.

Traders and exchanges move copper globally to match supply and demand. Lately, traders have leaned more on Chinese buyers to take extra supply, especially when U.S. trade tensions make North American buyers less certain.

If the U.S. slapped a 50% tariff on imported copper and a 35% tariff on Canadian imports, costs would spike for American manufacturers. Domestic mining can’t fully cover demand, so prices for copper wire, pipes, and components would jump. Canada supplies not just copper but lumber, steel, aluminum, and machinery parts, so tariffs there would push up costs for construction, autos, and clean energy projects.

Manufacturers would likely pass some costs to consumers or see profits shrink, while facing global competitors with cheaper inputs. Retaliation from Canada and Latin American producers could hurt U.S. exporters in other sectors. Higher costs would feed inflation and draw political backlash, making such tariffs hard to sustain for long.

Some stocks could see sharp swings if this happened. On the NYSE, Freeport-McMoRan, Southern Copper, GM, Nucor, and Tesla could be more volatile as copper costs and trade flows shift. In Canada, Teck Resources, First Quantum, Hudbay Minerals, Magna International, and Barrick Gold might also swing as exports adjust, buyers shift to China, and investors react.

In short, the copper supply chain runs from mine to factory through global trade routes. Big tariffs would disrupt that flow, help U.S. miners briefly, but squeeze manufacturers, raise prices, push more supply to China, and likely face strong pressure to be rolled back.

Copper is the Higgs Boson of manufacturing, watching us like a Bozo! it is everywhere..",

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

* Fewer formations of brick-and-mortar banks are replacing the ones that are gone.
* Physical bank branch reliance is quickly dissipating. The younger demographic generation is quicker to adapt to online banking, while the older population is also catching up to the trend.

Many large banks have announced that more closures will happen in 2025:

* Bank of America: Closing 27 locations
* JPMorgan Chase: Closing 15 locations
* Flagstar: Closing 52 locations
* TD Bank: Closing 37 locations
* U.S. Bank: Closing 40 locations

2025-07-11 13:23:58+00:00,MSFT,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Trump posted: ‘The stock market is at an all-time high and interest rates should be cut immediately’! - Former U.S. President Donald Trump just posted heavy rhetoric on social media, praising tech, industrial stocks and cryptocurrencies for their big gains and strongly calling on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Let's break down what he said and analyze the current state of the market with the latest data. Tech stocks, industrial stocks, Nasdaq hit record highs, cryptocurrencies “break through the sky” Nvidia (NVDA) is up 47% since the tariffs, the U.S. made hundreds of billions of dollars from the tariffs the country came back and called on the Fed to immediately cut interest rates declaring that “there is no inflation” .

How does the market interpret this?

Expectations for rate cuts are heating up: inflation is falling back + political heat is rising in a campaign year, Trump's statement may create some public pressure on the Fed (although its independence remains).

Tariffs negative turned positive? : Despite initial concerns that the market was under pressure, from the perspective of capital rotation, industrial, AI and defense stocks have risen, and it seems that the “Made in the USA” narrative is stronger.

Nvidia became a symbol: as the AI concept leader, NVDA after the tariffs rose against the trend, became the representative of the “no fear of policy uncertainty”, ARM, SMCI, AVGO, etc. also strengthened, the whole AI plate into the “revaluation period”.

Follow-up possible trend?

If the next Fed officials do not rush to suppress the rate cut expectations, the market may be the following scenarios

 Long beneficiary direction: tech giants (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL), interest rate sensitive growth stocks (ARKK, SMH), industrial/infrastructure stocks (CAT, DE, GE)

Risks to watch out for: QQQ/SPY technicals are close to overheating, Powell or other officials release hawkish letters, earnings season is approaching, and there could be a “positive cash-out-on-decline” 

What do our Reddit friends think?

Do you think Trump is just “rubbing it in” or is the impact of his policies really being priced into the market?

Will the Fed turn dovish under this political pressure?

Are you still holding NVDA? Or are you planning to bag it before earnings?",

2025-07-11 14:24:42+00:00,CAT,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Trump just announced tariffs on Canada. How does this affect global investors? - That's right. ... Trump is back to “spicing things up” for Canada. On July 11, 2025, the U.S. formally announced that it would be raising tariffs on a range of Canadian goods, and global markets have already begun to react to the news.

But what does this mean for us investors - whether we're trading, long-term holders, or have exposure to North American assets?

Why this is worth watching:

North American supply chains could be disrupted 

Ford, GM, Tesla, and even Apple - all of these companies rely heavily on cross-border US/Canada supply chains.

Tariff hikes = higher costs = pressured earnings, which could start to show up in next quarter's earnings.



Canadian markets under pressure 

The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) is already down 1.2% on the news. Sectors such as resource exports and technology parts may come under pressure in the short term.

Money may shift to U.S. industrials 

If you own U.S.-based industrials like CAT (Caterpillar), DE (Deere), NUE (Nucor Steel), or \*\*LMT (Loma), then this wave may be a positive instead.

My take: 

This isn't just a tariff issue - it's an extension of campaign year political gamesmanship. When news like this hits the ground, the market usually fluctuates and digests it later, with sentiment often reacting before fundamentals.

Short-term positive directions: 

US domestic industrial, construction, steel stocks 

AI/EV supply chains not dependent on Canadian imports 

Potential risk areas: 

Canadian tech exporters 

US-Canadian car joint ventures 

If the situation deteriorates further, the raw materials and energy sectors will suffer as well 

What do you think?

Would you reduce your exposure to the Canadian market?

Will you be hedging with options or will you continue to wait and see?

Will you take advantage of the volatility and do some short-term trading?

The markets are really hot and crazy right now, and it's not just the weather.",

Right now I’ve noticed volume lower than usual like before when Trump was going on about tariffs and the news saying record amounts of money being dumped by individual investors. I know the Vix tracks volatility and that’s a good metric but is there any other data easily accessible I should be looking at? 

Because I know there’s a way to check in yahoo finance which institutions hold positions in certain companies but I haven’t seen anything that easily shows me like if there was $200m volume today 60% of it was funds and the rest was retail. 

I really want to know if it’s retail piling in on fomo and can’t control their emotions bringing stocks to all time highs. Nvidia keeps going up even though a 50% copper tariff affects semiconductors and things are uncertain with China. It seems the market efficient hypothesis begins to be less true as retail traders join the race. ",

I’ve been diving into the em - Humanoid robots robots that can walk, manipulate objects, interact with humans have been stuck in sci-fi and R&D labs for decades. That’s rapidly changing:**Tesla Optimus** is already performing warehouse tasks**China’s UBTech** delivered >1,000 units to factories**Xpeng** and **Agility Robotics** are testing models for last-mile delivery**Nvidia**, **Intel**, and **AMD** are providing the “brains” with robotics-grade AI chips**Fanuc**, **ABB**, and others are improving small-scale actuators and motors

# Market ProjectionsGoldman Sachs: humanoid robots could become a $154B market by 2035Morgan Stanley: the market could scale to $5 trillion by 2050 (if penetration reaches 10% of global workforce tasks)

These are obviously fa  off projections, but here’s what’s compelling: the **entire robotics supply chain** chips, motors, sensors, material input (e.g. rare earths), and software is already public and investable.

# One ETF That Caught My Eye: KOID (KraneShares Humanoid & Embodied AI ETF)

I don’t own it (yet), but I’ve been tracking KOID closely. It's the first ETF I’ve seen that is **dedicated entirely to the humanoid and embodied AI ecosystem**. What's unique

**Equal-weight strategy** across \~40 global stocks (no Nvidia-dominated concentration)

Companies across **semis, robotics hardware, actuators, and embodied AI platforms**

U.S., Japan, China, Korea all represented

Low overlap (\~11%) with the Nasdaq 100

This seems like a good complement to existing AI or general robotics plays. More of a **long-duration thematic tracker**, similar to how clean energy or cybersecurity ETFs emerged years before mass adoption.

# Questions:Anyone else watching this theme?Thoughts on whether humanoid robotics will hit industrial scale in the next decade?  Any single name stocks you'd favor over a basket approach here?

I’m not affiliated with KOID, KraneShares, or any fund manager. Just sharing early-stage research.

2025-07-11 22:57:59+00:00,SO,reddit.com/r/stocks,"The Trump Administration appears to be preparing to reschedule cannabis from schedule 1 to 3 - So if you've been following weed stocks at all you likely know that they've been absolutely in the dumps for the past 4.5 years, dropping 95%+ from the ATHs that they set shortly after the 2020 election where Democrats promised to enact cannabis reforms which never materialized.

The closest that they got was when Biden initiated the scheduling review process for cannabis in 2022, which led to HHS recommending that it should be rescheduled to 3 in 2023, but this process has since stalled in legal limbo with the DEA who were fighting back against the rescheduling effort.

Trump's position on cannabis has been largely unknown given his few comments on the issue but the general consensus has been that he supports rescheduling to 3, state's rights to choose and SAFE banking, which would give cannabis businesses access to the federal banking system. Along this thought, Trump posted this on truth social in September 2024 leading up to the most recent election:

>As President, we will continue to focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug, and work with Congress to pass common sense laws, including safe banking (sic) for state authorized companies, and supporting states rights to pass marijuana laws, like in Florida, that work so well for their citizens.

Despite those comments, the major US cannabis ETF, $MSOS, dropped by over 50% overnight on election day after Trump won, showing that investors had little to no confidence in any positive reform measures coming from the new administration.

Since late June there has been a notable shift. Mike Tyson, a long time friend of Trump for over 30+ years, has been on a media campaign pushing him to finish the rescheduling process that Biden started. This is something that Trump can do on his own without congress. Along with this in the past 2 weeks, there has been a coordinated messaging campaign amongst MAGA social media influencers with millions of followers saying almost identical messaging about how they support Trump's promise to reschedule cannabis to 3 and how it's a good compromise between keeping criminal penalties but allowing more medical research

Just a few examples from the past week alone:

[https://nitter.net/GuntherEagleman/status/1942586646685249971](https://nitter.net/GuntherEagleman/status/1942586646685249971) (1.4M+ followers)

>As a former police officer, I strongly support President Trump on wanting to reschedule marijuana from schedule I to a schedule III.

>Foreign nations are outpacing the U.S. in medical marijuana research, and we must take the lead. Rescheduling is an effective compromise it maintains illegality while enabling critical studies to advance our understanding and innovation in this field.

[https://nitter.net/DC\_Draino/status/1942325611672056152](https://nitter.net/DC_Draino/status/1942325611672056152)  (2.2M+ followers)

>Cannabis is absurdly classified alongside heroin as a Schedule I drug and treated more harshly than fentanyl

>Does anyone actually think that makes sense?

>Trump’s campaign promise to move cannabis to Schedule 3 seems like a good compromise

>It maintains criminal penalties while also unlocking critical medicinal research that can save lives

[https://nitter.net/alexbruesewitz/status/1942679927855133017](https://nitter.net/alexbruesewitz/status/1942679927855133017) (Trump Advisor 500k+ followers)

>It's illogical that cannabis is classified as more dangerous than fentanyl. During the campaign President Trump expressed support for rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III, maintaining its illegal status but clearing the path for more robust medical research in our country. Nearly 70% of Republican voters support Trump on this. No brainer!

There are many more, and even the prohibitionist group, SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana) today claimed that rescheduling was coming very soon in a call to action before swiftly deleting their post  [https://nitter.net/tomangell/status/1943760858821406804](https://nitter.net/tomangell/status/1943760858821406804)

While nothing is confirmed yet, this aligns with recent chatter that this is all a ""soft launch"" to prepare everyone for cannabis rescheduling

>Based on what we’re hearing from multiple sources, rescheduling is essentially a sure thing that'll be heavily promoted by Trump in the coming weeks, with a soft-launch underway by many of his supporters/advisors. Given past delays, nothing is set in stone, but optimism is high.

Following this shift, $MSOS has double bottomed off of all time lows in late June at around the $2.00 level and is up 43% since, yet to this day, $MSOS is still down nearly 60% from it's price on election day and 46% down from the gap down open that followed election night which was never retested. IMO, any confirmation of rescheduling directly from the administration would quickly bring us back to those levels.

If rescheduling does occur, it would remove the 280e tax burden on US cannabis companies, a tax law that currently prevents them from taking tax deductions which forces them to pay 70%+ tax rates and prevents many from ever being profitable, and would bring their tax rates down to levels comparable with other businesses. It would also mean that the federal government acknowledges that cannabis has actual medical uses which would have a wide array of benefits like more research and federal medical cannabis regulations.

My favorite US cannabis company stocks are $GTBIF, which is already profitable and growing among a sea of money losers, and to a smaller extent $TCNNF, which has great margins but is playing a tax game where they're not paying 280e now in hopes that it gets removed which is a larger risk but that's reflected in the stock price",

For example: assume I invested  $10 000 to NVDA stock in beginning of 2020, after 5 years, it gained 1,473.66% which means I would have $147 366 now.

This allin method has advantages:

\- Much bigger gain than swing trading? I have this conception but it is good if some swing traders can confirm that.

\- No tax paid over years (big gains!) compared to swing tradings which I would need to pay tax (in EU) from capital gain

  
What do you think?

She said don't be surprised to see earnings be better than expected.  After I heard that, I had lunch with a financial advisor, and I asked him what he thought of the markets despite all the talk that they're overbought.  He agreed with Stephanie in that earnings should be good because who's really going to know if companies are being honest or not with their upcoming earnings.   In the past 6 months, the country has gotten rid of its checks and balances.  Just think when the last time was that the SEC penalized anyone or any company for illegal dealings.  It sure didn't happen in 2008 and it's not happening now.

Even apples data point was quickly disproven; Apple exec noted *safari* searches dipped; NOT Google queries from iOS devices.  This could be due to safari losing market share to chrome.  Google itself confirmed that iOS google queries are increasing not decreasing. 

If a move were to happen it probably would have happened when ChatGPT had a unique product; but there’s several models which have the same quality (Claude Gemini and even Grok), including embedded into Google search itself

Gemini app (not AI overviews, but actual product) has 400M MAU already 

The narrative seems so disconnected from reality thus I am all in $GOOG

Right now if search revenue was $0, Google’s PE would be less than Microsoft’s. and that’s for a bunch of hyper growth businesses (YouTube Waymo GCP TPU etc)

For those who whole heartedly believe search has died, what metrics are you using?

>The London-bound plane had barely left the runway at Ahmedabad airport when it hurtled back to earth. Everyone on board was killed, except for one passenger.

>According to the report by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, obtained by CNN, the fuel control switches in the cockpit of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner had been flipped, starving the engines of fuel. The report does not say whether the control switches were flipped by a person or in another way.

>Investigators were able to get data out of the plane’s “black box” recorders, including 49 hours of flight data and two hours of cockpit audio, including from the crash.

>The aircraft had reached an airspeed of 180 knots when both engines’ fuel cutoff switches were “transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec,” according to the report.

>“In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” the report reads.

>Shortly after, the switches were reversed back to where they should have been, and the engines were in the process of powering back up when the crash happened.

>On the 787, the fuel cutoff switches are between the two pilots’ seats, immediately behind the plane’s throttle levers. They are protected on the sides by a metal bar and have a locking mechanism designed to prevent accidental cutoff.

>Airport footage shows the Ram Air Turbine, an emergency power source on an aircraft, deployed during the plane’s initial climb after takeoff, the report said. The plane started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall.

>“When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction,” the report states.

>Seconds after the engines attempted to relight, one pilot called out, “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY.” The controller called out for the plane’s callsign, but didn’t get a response and watched the plane crash in the distance.

>The fuel switches were “designed to be intentionally moved,” according to CNN safety analyst David Soucie, who said cases in which all fuel switches were turned off accidentally are “extremely rare.”

>“Throughout the years, those switches have been improved to make sure that they cannot be accidentally moved and that they’re not automatic. They don’t move themselves in any manner,” Soucie said on Friday.

>The captain of the flight was a 56-year-old who had flown more than 15,000 hours in his career. The first officer was a 32-year old man with over 3,400 flying hours.

>Investigators also noted settings on equipment found in the wreckage was normal for takeoff. The plane’s fuel was tested and found to be of satisfactory quality, and no significant bird activity is observed in the vicinity of the flight path, according to the report.

>The takeoff weight for the plane was found to be within allowable limits, and there were no “Dangerous Goods” on the aircraft. Investigators found the flaps on the wings of the plane were set in the 5-degree position, which is correct for takeoff, and the landing gear lever was in the down position.

>The left engine was installed on the plane on March 26 and the right was installed on May 1, the report said.

>One of the relatives of an Air India victim called for the perpetrators to be punished following the release of the preliminary report. Naresh Maheswari, whose son died in the crash urged the investigators to be neutral, telling India’s ANI news agency that “we want no one else to die due to such carelessness.”

>The brother-in-law of another of the victims, Niraj Patel, said: “We want the government to take all kinds of precautions so that people do not lose their family members to such incidents again.”

>The Air India jet took off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in India’s western state of Gujarat on June 12. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner was headed to London Gatwick and scheduled to land at 6:25 p.m. local time.

>Air India had said 242 passengers and crew members were on board. That included 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian.

>In addition to those on board, a number of people on the ground were killed when the plane crashed into the BJ Medical College and Hospital hostel.

>The crash resulted in 260 fatalities total, according to the report. A number of the dead on the ground resulted from the plane hitting the hostel.

>Air India acknowledged that it received the report and said it will continue cooperating with authorities in the investigation.

>“Air India stands in solidarity with the families and those affected by the AI171 accident,” the airline posted to X on Saturday (local time). “We continue to mourn the loss and are fully committed to providing support during this difficult time.”

2025-07-12 22:00:17+00:00,UPS,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Allegion : what am I missing ? (ALLE, ASSA-B, DOKA) - Hello,

It seems to me that nobody cares about Allegion. Please tell why you haven't bought it or why you wouldn't. I already made a post elsewhere and nobody answered. In this post I also speak about major competitors Assa Abloy and Dormakaba

# Allegion (ALLE)

Allegion is a lock, (automatic) door and anti-fire window manufacturer. It also made investments in various technology start-ups (Allegion Ventures). It is a spin-off from Ingersoll Rand (the old one) in 2014. It has a high profitability and is a serial acquirer.

**Asset allocation**

It makes a good number of acquisitions, but also some divestments from time to time. If you look at the constant high profitability (10%-17% since 2016), we can say it is selective with its acquisitions. They continue to make a lot of money on their total assets. Notable acquisition : Stanley access technologies in 2022 from Stanley Black & Decker, that is their entry in the automatic door market.

They use a high leverage (equity ratio of about 30%), they distribute about 30% of their earnings and are doing a lot of buyback (37% of earnings for \~1.2% of outstanding shares (net of dillution) in average) at attractive prices (at the moment at least).

In 2025 they bought :

\* Waitwhile (queue managing software)

\* Gatewise (access control software for multi-family buildings)

\* Next door (US glass/metal and metal doors manufacturer for commercial buildings)

\* Trimco (manufacturer of custom/branded door handles)

\* Lemaar (residential door handles in Australia)

\* Novas (door handles, electronic locks, door sealing in Australia)

\* ELATEC (electronic locks in Germany)

**Evolution of earnings (USD)**

2.36 (16), 2.85 (17), 4.54 (18), 4.26 (19), 3.39 (20), 5.34 (21), 5.19 (22), 6.12 (23), 6.82(24), 7.12 (rolling 12)

Dividend went from 0.64 to 2.04. The dividends are subject to irish witholding tax.

**Management & board**

There is a good stability in the management, eventhough CEO John Stone has been hired in 2022.

For example SVP International Timothy Eckersley was managing the american commercial activities of what was to become Allegion in 2007-2013, then the Americas division (this time including residential as well) in 2013-2020 before leading the international business from 2021. SVP Americas David Llardi joined the group in 2008 and was promoted in 2022. ( [https://ibb.co/jvxb5CyT](https://ibb.co/jvxb5CyT) )

It is less the case on the board with some recent departures of long-time members. ( [https://ibb.co/zWHs08L2](https://ibb.co/zWHs08L2) )

**Other**

There is some risks about the tariffs, considering for example that some of the manufacturing for the american market is done in Mexico.

# Assa Abloy

Assa Abloy is a lock, window elements, (automatic) door and gate manufacturer. It is a merger from 1994 between Assa and Abloy. It has an average profitability. It is 3 times bigger than Allegion.

**Asset allocation**

It makes a good number of acquisitions. If you look at the lower profitability (9%-11.5%, except for 2018), we can say it is less selective with its acquisitions than Allegion. Notable acquisitions : HHI (Kwikset, Baldwin & Weiser etc.) for 4.3B$ in 2023, that is most of their North American residential business segment. The group has a bigger diversification in term of businesses (senior care alarms, RFID for uniforms, perimeter security etc).

They use a lower leverage (equity ratio of about 50%), they distribute about 45% of their earnings. They don't really buy back their shares.

**Evolution of earnings (SEK)**

5.99 (16), 7.77 (17), 2.48 (18\*), 9.22 (19), 7.54 (20), 9.81 (21), 11.97 (22), 13.54 (23), 14.09 (24), 14.17 (rolling 12m)

\*goodwill impairement China

Dividend went from 3 to 5.9. The dividends are subject to swedish witholding tax.

**Management & Board**

There is a good stability in term of management. CEO Nico Delvaux has been hired in his position in 2018. ( [https://ibb.co/TDGx1h4x](https://ibb.co/TDGx1h4x) )

There is always 3-4 members of the board sent by major sharholders Latour and Schörling ( [https://ibb.co/xtRKCvBh](https://ibb.co/xtRKCvBh) )

**Other**

There is some risks about the tariffs as they now make 47% of their sales in the US.

The company is controlled by long term shareholders Latour and Schörling.

# Dormakaba

Dormakaba is a lock, door, movable wall, key machine manufacturer. Dormakaba is the result of the 2015 merger between swiss Kaba and german Dorma. The swiss holding (what you buy on the stock market) owns 52.5% of the german holding (who owns all the businesses). The ex-owners of Dorma kept 47.5% of the german holding and of the merged activities. In addition, the ex-owners of Dorma, together with some ex-owners of Kaba own a total of 28% of the swiss holding. It is the smallest company of the 3.

The company has very low margins (remember to not exclude earnings of the minority interests to calculate profitability as most of them are the 47.5%). It has made some acquisitions, some of them beeing service companies, but it also made a lot of divestments in recent years.

**Evolution of earnings (CHF)**

12.8 (16), 27.7 (17), 29.5 (18), 31.5 (19), 20.3 (20), 24.1 (21), 15.1 (22), 10.9 (23), 10 (24), 16 (rolling 12m)

Dividend went from 12 to 8. The dividends are subject to swiss witholding tax (partly).

# Conclusion

I don't understand why Allegion has a P/E of 20.9 in itself. Assa Abloy, which is not as good, has a P/E of 21.4. Dormakaba, which is the worst, has a P/E of 46.75. Has anybody an idea about what I am missing ?

The ""negative"" elements don't seem to explain why it is cheap. Yes, there is a tariff risk (same as a lot of companies), there is irish witholding tax, I guess it could get out of S&P500 due to its size (#436 a month ago). The company doesn't have some caracteristics that a lot of investor want (it is an industrial company and it is not a dividend aristrocrat YET).

Please note that I own shares in Allegion and that might influence my opinion on the group.",

2025-07-13 11:21:55+00:00,COST,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Powell's ouster 'one of the biggest underestimated event risks in the coming months - U.S. President Donald Trump's potential removal of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could lead to a ‘meltdown’ in currency and bond markets and a spike in inflation expectations, Deutsche Bank said on Friday.

Earlier this week, Russell Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, accused Powell of ‘gross’ mismanagement of the Fed and said renovations to the Fed's headquarters were ‘way over budget’ and that the cost of the project had ballooned to about $2.5 billion.

The allegation could open the door for Trump to seek Powell's removal. The president has repeatedly criticised the Fed chairman for failing to lower interest rates and has hurled a series of insults at him. He has reportedly considered firing Powell and appointing a successor before the end of his term.

George Salaveros, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, noted that the market now expects Powell's ouster to be very unlikely. According to forecasting platform Polymarket, the likelihood of Powell stepping down is currently 15 per cent.

But Salaveros offered some thoughts on the possible implications.

He says: ""The empirical and academic evidence on the impact of a loss of central bank independence is fairly clear: in the extreme case, both currency and bond markets could collapse as inflation expectations rise, real yields fall, and broader risk premiums rise due to institutional erosion. Interestingly, the implications for equities are even more ambivalent given that they are ultimately a claim on real assets.""

It is difficult to quantify the impact on FX and interest rates, but in the first 24 hours after Powell's announcement of his departure, we expect the trade-weighted dollar to fall by at least 3-4 per cent, while US fixed income will suffer a 30-40 basis point sell-off, led by the back end,’ Salaveros said.

According to the analyst, the market's reaction to the initial news will depend on whether the remaining Fed policymakers ‘agree’ around the central bank's independence, the choice of Powell's successor, and the broader macroeconomic context.

He added: ‘All in all, we see Chairman Powell's departure as one of the biggest underestimated event risks in the coming months.’

This week, trade dynamics have been at the centre of Wall Street's attention, overshadowing monetary policy and the Federal Reserve. Here are some of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the benchmark S&P 500 Index ( SP500 ): ( NYSEARCA: SPY ), ( NYSEARCA: VOO ), ( NYSEARCA: IVV ), ( NYSEARCA: RSP ), ( NYSEARCA: SSO ), ( NYSEARCA: UPRO ), ( NYSEARCA: SH ), ( NYSEARCA: SDS ) and ( NYSEARCA: SPXU ).

Secretary of Defense, Hegseth’s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. 

The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports.

""While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,"" Hegseth said in the video online. ""Not anymore.""

The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by ""approving hundreds of American products"" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a ""variety of low-cost drones"" made by American engineers and AI experts.

The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use.

""Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,"" the memo said.

Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars.

""Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,"" Hegseth wrote in the memo.

The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace.",

U.S. Equity Inflows Cooling Off

Offshorelisted U.S. focused ETFs saw $4.7B in net outflows over the past 20 weeks with 11 outflow weeks during that stretch

This marks a shift from the $160B in inflows between mid-2023 and early 2025

Even as the S&P 500 climbs foreign demand appears to be weakening.

Europe and Emerging Markets Gain Traction

Europefocused ETF logged $15B in net inflows across 21 of the past 24 weeks Emerging markets ETF pulled in $13.6B over 23 weeks with momentum picking up significantly since late January This rotation aligns with weakening U.S. equity flows and dollar softness.

Asia A Mixed Picture

South Korea ETFs saw $1.4B in inflows over six weeks possibly tied to AI optimism and governance reformsIndia rebounded with $1.8B in ETF inflows since late March after a stretch of outflows

Taiwan & Japan Attracting foreign capital via direct equities rather than ETF

China/Hong Kong Continued ETF outflows aside from brief state-supported buying windows

The post-2023 U.S. equity dominance theme is under review Investors appear to be reallocating toward markets with relative valuation appeal currency tailwinds or structural reform narratives

Still early to call a definitive shift  but flows are speaking louder than price action right now

   * **Rationale**: Successful Idaho reactor progress, 1–2 new contracts (30–100 MW), and AI-driven demand sustain a high P/S (20–25x) and speculative momentum. Regulatory tailwinds and data center LOIs (600 MW) boost [confidence.utilitydive.com](http://confidence.utilitydive.com)

   * **Rationale**: Minor delays in Idaho or regulatory hurdles limit revenue to $7.5–$10M by 2027. Lower P/S (10–15x) and reduced market enthusiasm cap upside. Cash burn ($65–$80M/year) may require minor dilution if costs [rise.forbes.com](http://rise.forbes.com)

**Ticker:** $YOU

**$$$ Scroll to the end if you want the ADHD Portfolio Manager's Cliff Notes $$$**

YOU has been quietly cashing checks while everyone's been distracted by NVDA vs. ARM cage matches. Im talking real profits, government-grade access, and a fat pile of cash. The cherry on top? They're pivoting into a another revenue stream. They have a B2B SaaS expansion plan that (might) just take them from TSA side hustle to enterprise verification empire.

**So who is YOU anyway?**

Clear Secure is the company behind those VIP ""skip the line"" biometric lanes in airports, stadiums, and other big venues. It's the TSA PreCheck if TSA actually moved at human speed. They call it Clear Plus, and it's already used by 30M+ people.

Then there's the revenue pivot... CLEAR1, a B2B identity verification platform. Think: LinkedIn, Uber, and even T-Mobile using Clear tech to make sure users/employees aren't bots or stolen IDs. IF that hits? You're looking at a low-key SaaS transformation.

**Lets talk money**

* FCF margins: 40%+
* GAAP profitable with net income up 6x YoY
* Zero debt, $1.3 billie in cash (if you did the math then yes... That's $9-10/share just sitting there)
* And they're buying back shares AND paying a dividend like a grown up (isnt that cute)

**What can send this thing on the next flight to the moon?**

* CLEAR1 traction. Need some proof of concept? They just inked 20+ enterprise deals. $TMUS already live
* Index inclusion or analyst upgrades
* Expansion into new airports/stadiums/venues... aka more sticky skip the line subscribers trying to cut you in line (dont we love those guys...)

**No Risk No Reward am I right?**

Risks include:

* If CLEAR1 fizzles and ends up being a LinkedIn footnote
* Leadership shakeup (founder/CFO stepped down recently)
* Some political grandstanding kills airport access

**Is it a good risk reward profile?**

* Floor: Strong cash pile, recurring subs, no debt. It would take a lot to set this thing below $20 so thats where I am estimating the floor.
* Ceiling: Mid thirties is totally reasonable on execution, possibly $40+ if CLEAR1 becomes the next Okta-for-humans
* Current PPS: $29
* Target PPS: $34-36
* Expected Upside: Approx 20-25%
* Divvy? Small, but real .6% plus buybacks

The market still sees this as a fancy airport perk company. What I see is optionality and a floor.

**$$$ TL;DR  for my fellow ADHD Portfolio Managers: $$$**

* Real biz, real margins, real upside
* B2C moat + B2B growth = Juicy hybrid
* CLEAR1 is the wildcard that could re-rate the company to the upside
* Floor's solid, ceiling's open. Short interest adds some spice
* If they execute, $YOU could quietly double in 2-3 years. If not? Still not trash

Summary Stats:

* Target: $34-36
* Current: $29
* Upside: 20-24%
* Grade: Pearl-ish if they dont fumble the bag",

Retailers recorded online sales growth of 30.3% during events that included Amazon Prime Day, Adobe said on Saturday, compared with [its projections of ](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-set-lift-us-online-sales-238-billion-adobe-estimates-2025-07-07/)28.4%.

Several major retailers including e-commerce giant [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) [(AMZN.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O), Walmart [(WMT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/WMT.N), Target [(TGT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TGT.N) as well as Best Buy [(BBY.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/BBY.N) have been launching deal events with strong discounts, encouraging shoppers to trade up on expensive items they might normally pass on.

[Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) extended its sales window to 96 hours, up from the typical 48, featuring aggressive promotions on categories ranging from apparel to electronics.

A wave of enticing deals comes at a time when heightened trade tensions amid the Trump administration's volatile tariff policies have rattled consumers and businesses, and as the new August 1 deadline for countries to renegotiate trade agreements with the United States looms.

pls no debate about mistral, or if you like them, if they are good, if we should support eu more and  blabla;

my point is mistral is the last ai company a company with trillions on the bank should buy;

so is apple running out of options?

if yes why?

do the top-tier acquisition targets consider apple as a lame duck?

is this something which will impact your long-term pos on apple?

2025-07-14 08:23:34+00:00,TSLA,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Why i hold UNH while reducing positions on other stocks - From April to July 2025, institutions were quietly accumulating **UnitedHealth (UNH)** adding **\~12 million shares** and increasing portfolio allocation by **\~34%**.

We're talking **Vanguard (+8M)** and **BlackRock (+2.3M)**

At the same time, due to market uncertainty, filings show many funds were trimming **TSLA, NVDA, and even AAPL**, yet UNH got more love.

Then in June? A **$6.2M LEAPS call sweep** (Dec 2025, $290 strike). This isn’t retail peasants like us trading daddies money.   
That’s smart money making a long-dated, high-conviction bet.

# Here's where it gets juicy:

* End of June: Short interest spiked, price dipped below support
* Early July: Price reversed hard → shorts got nuked
* Classic bear trap setup + quiet accumulation by institutions

#  What to Expect

* Late July = potential breakout trigger from earnings or on the run up to earnings.
* **Fake dip likely** → don’t get shaken
* If fundamentals hold, holding firm may outperform chasing 

Institutions are already positioned they don’t need perfect timing, they need long-term upside

If earnings later this month show:

* Stable cost ratios
* Good Medicare enrollment
* No DOJ bombshells ... then the accumulation zone around $290–305 may end up being the best entry range",

2025-07-14 13:23:57+00:00,BA,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Stocks Rise, Trump Speaks Out, Cryptocurrencies Surge - What Happened Today?
Folks, it's been another restless Monday. - Just before the U.S. stock market opens, several key stocks and sectors are getting restless:

Top U.S. Stocks Pre-Market Movers for July 14th:

Tesla (TSLA) up over 1% 

Boeing (BA) also up about 1% 

Cryptocurrency Concepts Are Taking Off 

Azure (NIO) surges about 5% as new energy vehicles heat up again 

Meanwhile, Trump is on Truth Social again: the Nasdaq, tech, industrials - all at record highs. Cryptocurrencies are going crazy. The Fed should cut rates immediately. Inflation? Doesn't exist!

Three major thrusts behind today's market rally:

Positive macro data 

CPI inflation data released last week came in at 3.2% (y/y), which was lower than market expectations 

Markets are starting to bet that the Fed may cut rates sooner 

US bond yields have come down (10-year Treasuries are currently around 3.84%) 

Trump's statements have heated up expectations 

He has publicly called for an “immediate cut in interest rates” 

said. “He's the reason the market is at record highs” 

Whether you agree or not, the market loves any dovish (rate cut) signal, even if it's a political shout 

Hot Sectors Rotate 

Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin back above $83,000, Ether follows 

→ COIN, MSTR, MARA and other related stocks all in the red pre-market 

New Energy Vehicles. NIO leads the way, TSLA steady - may be related to China stimulus and rumors of lower battery costs 

INDUSTRY & AEROSPACE: Boeing shines as it benefits from defense export expectations and capital rotation

Three things I'm watching this week:

Earnings season is here: tech giants start announcing earnings this week, will it continue to push the market higher or be a head-scratcher?

Fed officials statement: will they make a hawkish counterattack to the “Trump-style rate cut shouts”?

Sector rotation risk: will AI, tech stocks top out? Is money flowing into crypto, industrials, energy?

What do you think:

Will you get on board with this Trump wave? Or are you ready to reverse course?

NIO Is it for real this time or just another high and low?

Does anyone else feel like this scenario resembles the eve of that early 2020's bull market?",

2025-07-14 13:25:18+00:00,SO,reddit.com/r/stocks,"HSBC: USD Selling Looks Like a Bubble  Bottom May Be Near? - HSBC just dropped a note saying the relentless dollar selling is starting to look like an ""anti-bubble."" Basically, everyone's been piling on the short side so hard this year that it might be time for a bottom.

The dollar's down about 8% so far, driven by messy US policies and tariffs that have really rattled its safe-haven cred. HSBC thinks this one-sided bearish sentiment is overdone especially if the greenback starts tracking US yields again

Unless we see another major policy shock or unexpected moves from Powell, the sell-off might be nearing its end. I'm personally trimming some non-dollar assets because the extreme pessimism might have priced the worst in already

2025-07-14 13:43:36+00:00,NOW,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Asian stocks steady amid Trump's new tariff measures, China stocks rise on strong trade data; Wall Street futures fall - Asian stocks were mostly steady on Monday as investors reacted to new trade tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump, while Chinese shares rose on strong June trade data.



Heightened global trade friction also weighed on market sentiment as U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico from Aug. 1 onward.



In response, EU and Mexican officials have expressed a willingness to negotiate, and the EU has begun talks with other affected partners.



Gold prices hovered around $3,350 an ounce on Monday, near a three-week high.



Japan's stock market ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.01% Monday , falling below 39,500; the TSE stock index fell 0.2% to 2,817. Japanese stocks hit more than two-week lows as renewed trade tensions dampened market sentiment. The yen rose to 147 against the dollar on Monday, recovering some of the ground lost last week as investors reacted to renewed global trade concerns.



2025 In May, Japan's industrial production fell 0.1% from a year earlier, down from a preliminary 0.5% increase, after falling 1.1% in April, the second consecutive monthly decline.



On the economic front, Japan's core machinery orders fell 0.6% m/m to 913.5 billion yen in May.



On Monday, China (SSE Composite Index) gained 0.46% to above 3,525 points, while the SZSE Composite Index fell 0.2% to 10,670 points. Mainland stocks were mixed as investors weighed strong trade data against a fresh round of geopolitical tensions, with the offshore yuan trading at around 7.17 against the dollar on Monday.



In June 2025, China's trade surplus increased to $114.77 billion, with exports up 5.8% to $325.2 billion and imports up 1.1% to $210.4 billion.



Also adding support to the market was news that China and ASEAN plan to submit an upgraded free trade agreement for ratification in October.



Investors are now eyeing China's Q2 GDP data due on Tuesday, with growth expected to slow to 5.2% from 5.4% in the first quarter.



Hong Kong (Hang Seng) gained 0.77% to 24,190 in early trading on Monday, its third consecutive session of gains, after Goldman Sachs upgraded Hong Kong equities to market weight, citing strong earnings growth due to improving capital markets and a pickup in real estate activity.



India's (SENSEX) index fell 0.33% to 82,229 points in early trading Monday, hovering at its lowest level in two weeks and falling for a fourth straight session.



Australia's (AS51) index rose 0.01% to close at 8,572 points on Monday after falling slightly by 0.1%. U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his threat of tariffs, reigniting fears of an outbreak of a global trade war and causing investors to turn cautious. The Australian dollar fell to around $0.656 against the greenback on Monday, reversing last week's gains.



On Thursday, all three major U.S. stock indexes closed lower after President Trump announced 35% tariffs on Canadian imports and warned of further tariff increases globally



U.S. stock index futures fell sharply on Monday after President Trump threatened to impose 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico starting August 1st. : Dow Jones -0.40%; S&P 500 -0.44%; Nasdaq -0.40%.",

2025-07-14 13:53:10+00:00,NVDA,reddit.com/r/stocks,"EU issues tough warning of countermeasures if US-EU trade talks break down - will markets falter? - Background Sorting: 

Trade tensions between the US and Europe have heated up again over the past two weeks. Despite the departure of the Biden administration, Trump reinstated some of the tariffs on Europe prior to his campaign, particularly related to automobiles, precision manufacturing equipment and green energy products.

Today, EU Vice-President Sefcovic made it clear that if negotiations fail, the EU will not hesitate to take reciprocal countermeasures, including imposing tariffs or limits on U.S. high-tech products, cloud services and chip equipment.

Short-term market judgment: 

If the US-EU talks continue to stall, it will weigh on large-cap tech stocks in the short- to medium-term, especially for companies with high international revenue share (e.g., NVDA, AAPL, AMD).

However, if positive signals of progress in negotiations can be released later this week, the market will repair quickly.

The current rise in volatility expectations for August in the options market suggests that institutions are already hedging their bets against conflicting risks.

My strategy (not a recommendation): 

Lightly hold tech ETFs (e.g. QQQ) and closely monitor the EU response meeting on 7/16 

If conflict escalates, plan to buy short-term defensive ETFs (e.g. XLU / SH) if the VIX breaks 15+ 

Watch for shifts in international stances during the Biden and Trump campaigns, as the policy set-ups will influence the direction of capital allocation in Sept.

What do our Reddit friends think?

Do you think the EU will really do something to counter it, or is it just a bargaining chip?

How will the escalation of the U.S.-EU trade war affect your holdings (especially tech stocks)?

How do you plan to hedge your bets if things continue to deteriorate?",

2025-07-14 14:26:54+00:00,SO,reddit.com/r/stocks,"The future of film. Netflix or some other company? - Netflix has announced that they will begin showing AI generated ads in 2026. It's pretty clear what happens from there. What starts as 15-30 second AI-generated advertisements shown in the middle of your favorite TV series eventually evolves into 40-50 minute AI-generated episodes that *become* your new favorite TV series.

At some point in the not too distant future, and perhaps sooner than you think, the major streaming platforms will start rolling out feature-length films and TV series created entirely with AI. Over time, the quality will improve to be indistinguishable from real life.

The future of film is not in big budget productions with a cast of A-list stars. The future of film is in AI-generated content, created for pennies on the dollar and with very few human actors. Movies and series will be produced not over several months or years on set at some studio in Hollywood but in a few days or hours from who knows where. Like Bibles with the introduction of the printing press, they'll be produced in the thousands.

And companies can limit their exposure to risk by shifting to an On Demand model. Sure, there will be established franchises like Marvel and Star Wars and others they'll keep dishing out, but long gone will be the days when a studio drops $150M on a movie that flops.

Because the future of film won't be just Netflix Original content (or another company's), much of it will be *your* content. You'll have the power of Gen AI at your fingertips.

It won't be long until you can log into Netflix or another platform, and with a simple prompt or a choice of a few options, generate an entire film or TV series that you can watch that day and share with your friends. User content will be circulated and rated like your aunt's potato salad recipe on Allrecipes.com.

Movies are inherently procedural. Every story, at least a decent one, has:

* Structure (Freytag's pyramid, Three-act Play, The Hero's Journey, etc)
* Plot (Rags to Riches, Overcoming the Monster, Comedy, Tragedy, and Rebirth, etc)
* Theme (Love, Good vs Evil, Coming of Age, etc)
* Tone (Serious, Uplifting, Bleak, etc)
* Conflict (Man vs Man, Man vs Society, Man vs Nature, etc)
* Characters (Humans, Elves, Demons, Robots, Zombies, etc)
* Setting (Present Day, Apocalyptic, Alternate Dimension, Mars, etc)

You'll be able mix and match all of these elements and generate a prompt. BOOM - you have a new film or TV series that you'll be the first to view. Give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and Netflix will learn from your prompt and produce better recipes tailored just for you. You'll be able to share it with your friends on Netflix too. Top rated user content will be owned by Netflix who can sell it or rent it. Maybe they'll give you a percentage of the profit.

If you want a franchise with 20 movies, you'll have it. If you want TV series with 50 seasons, you'll have it.

So, what could the future look like?

Netflix has a current market cap of $529B with subscriptions priced between $7.99 and $24.99/mo. It's not unrealistic to double, triple, or even quadruple these costs to provide what I just described. As a millennial, I remember paying $70ish for cable 10-15 years ago. You have to believe people will be willing to pay a similar cost for On Demand film.

Is it unrealistic to forecast Netflix with a market cap of $2T?

Perhaps it's Google (Alphabet), not Netflix who will capitalize on this - and they won't just stick to movies and series. They'll evolve YouTube into a Generative AI hub. Create film, series, vlogs, and more. Veo3 is impressive. How much more capable will it be in 10 years?

If Nvidia is building ""AI factories"" to produce off-the-shelf AI models, then on-demand AI film is not so far fetched.

They say Tom Cruise saved Hollywood with Top Gun 2. I believe he only bought them a bit of extra time.",

2025-07-14 15:05:41+00:00,NOW,reddit.com/r/stocks,"AI is overvalued - I am going to preface this with the fact I have worked in the AI field with some big companies for about 10 years now and understand everything about AI and how it works. 

I think a AI bubble is here, we are overvalueing every company that seems to use AI for the sole reason that it uses AI. We are creating a bubble of artificial valuation. AI has many uses and I do believe we will continue using it in the future, but that does not mean it is now the most powerful market indicator. The value of AI companies should be based on the integration value. Why does every AI company hit huge numbers shortly after the launch. It makes no sense. The whole point of valuation is how much shareholder value can they provide and with many of these new companies that number is real low. We are throwing money at these useless AI companies for absolutely no reason. We can look at a example of OpenAI. They are at the cutting edge of LLM  technology. It is never going to become the next ""Google"" and while I do think it is amazing what they do and I use Chatgpt often, why does everyone say they are undervalued. It isn't a trillion dollar company. That is just one dumb example though. The real overvaluation is the 75% of AI companies that are truly useless. We will always use AI in the future as a society, but it won't be a million companies, it will be the best of the best that we use for everything. 

There are countless AI companies that all think because they use AI they are the future, and we do fall for it. I think that in the near future there will be a AI burst. The bubble will finally collapse, it will hit everyone harder than we would ever expect. I have no idea when its going to happen, could be this year, could be next, and could be in 5 years. The overvaluation of AI is at least 50% artificial. 

Shorting AI might sound stupid, and it could be I am totally wrong, but what if I am right. 

Edit: I am not talking about the big hitters in the AI industry. The OpenAI, Palantir, Nvidia are all huge and extremely impactful. I am solely saying these are the companies that will survive. They are so ahead of everyone else that in 1 day they can teach a model to do virtually anything. Other companies will be forced to die out. This is just my prediction for the future of AI. ",

2025-07-14 17:52:24+00:00,NOW,reddit.com/r/stocks,"$MEOH (Methanex): Why no love? - Let me disclose upfront:

* I've held MEOH for 10+ years
* My avg cost is low $20s.
* I’m not trying to offload shares, I’m holding and might add.
* I'm posting here to get thoughts, build awareness (of course it helps boost my port value), and understand why it gets little or no attention.

# What is Methanex?

* World's largest methanol producer.
* Converts natural gas into methanol and ships it globally.
* Stable, profitable commodity business
* Canadian (based on Vancouver, BC)
* I can hear the yawns already

# OCI Acquisition

* \~$1.2B in cash
* \~9.9 million new MEOH shares (about 15% dilution)
* \~$450M in assumed debt/leases

Assets acquired:

* Two ""world-scale"" methanol plants in Beaumont, Texas
   * Includes OCI Beaumont and a 50% stake in Natgasoline (largest U.S. methanol plant)
   * One plant also produces ammonia
* A global low-carbon methanol production and marketing business (OCI HyFuels)
* An idled plant in the Netherlands (Delfzijl)

Why the idled plant?  
Delfzijl gives Methanex a pre-built, permitted foothold in Europe. It’s currently offline but useful for future growth or clean fuel mandates. In short, it gives them optionality, not immediate contribution.

# Stock Reaction

* Stock dropped \~25% since just before the OCI deal was announced on 9/8/24.
* $33.58 as I write this on 7/14/25
* CEO bought 2,958 shares (\~$150K) in mid-June at \~$37.50.
* BMO set a $65 target (>90% upside).

# Valuation Snapshot

* Trailing EPS (Q1 2025): about $3.29
* P/E ratio: about 10 to 11 times
* Forward P/E: about 13 times consensus
* Reasonable for a profitable, now larger, industrial business

# How much capacity did OCI add?

* Methanex now reports 10.4 million tonnes per year (mtpa) total operating capacity.
* OCI assets added about 2.6 mtpa active capacity, with optional upside from Delfzijl (about 1 mtpa idle).
* That's a \~44% increase in total potential capacity.

# EPS Upside Estimate

* If OCI is successfully integrated and margins hold:
   * EPS could rise from \~$3.30 to $4.50
* At that level, the forward P/E at today’s price ($34) would drop to \~7.5 to 8 times

# Future Stock Price Scenarios

|EPS|8× P/E|10× P/E|12× P/E|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$4.30|$34.40|$43.00|$51.60|
|$4.60|$36.80|$46.00|$55.20|

* Base case: $46 to 55 (if integration succeeds and valuation normalizes)
* Upside case: $60 or more (if methanol market strengthens or Europe ramps clean fuels)
* Downside case: Flat if OCI adds little and macro weakens

# What’s coming next?

Q2 Earnings on 7/30

* OCI deal closed 7/27, so only 3 days included in Q2
* Expect:
   * Confirmation of close
   * One-time charges
   * Management commentary
* Don’t expect:
   * Full OCI financials
   * Revised guidance (likely Q3)

Real impact shows up in Q3 (Oct/Nov) once OCI results are fully consolidated.

# Insider Buying History

|Date|Price|6‑Mo Ret|12‑Mo Ret|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mar 2020|$22.00|\+48%|\+120%|COVID recovery|
|Nov 2016|$35.00|\+15%|\+40%|Methanol supercycle|
|Aug 2014|$60.00|–20%|–35%|Oil crash|
|May 2012|$30.00|\+5%|\+25%|Steady growth|
|Jun 2025|$37.50|TBD|TBD|Post-OCI, stock now $33.40|

# Expected reader pushback:

* “Analyst targets are BS”: fair
* “Insider buys are small"": fair
* “You’re betting on OCI and methanol demand"": fair
* Canadian stock, so US investors get hit with foreign taw withdrawal on dividends
* Commodity stocks are volatile
* MEOH has little options interest and therefore lacks leverage/excitement, comparatively speaking

Here’s why I’m holding:

* I have a good cost basis.
* The capacity added by the acquisition of OCI is real, running and producing.
* EPS could rise 30 to 40 percent over time
* Forward P/E could drop to about 7.5 to 8 times
* Methanex has stayed profitable through multiple cycles.
* Balance sheet still manageable after the deal

#  Risks

* OCI integration underperforms
* Methanol demand weakens
* Trump tariff wars, macro instability (e.g. Chinese demand)
* Dilution doesn’t get offset by future earnings

#  Bottom Line

This isn’t a meme stock or a fast mover. It is a scaled-up, globally positioned chemical producer trading at about 10 to 11 times earnings now, possibly less than 8 times forward, with clear upside if execution goes right.

That's a lot of ""ifs,"" ""coulds,"" etc.

Still, I’m watching Q3. I’ll likely buy if it dips under $30.   
  
In the mean time, I'm wondering: Why no discussion for MEOH?

Thoughts?

I made the mistake of selling 2 year covered call leaps OTM. 
Expiry DEC 2026.

I had a goal amount to profit from the sale of the stock and realized the leap premium would reach that goal for me.

This past year some major contracts have spiked the stock to crazy levels way past the ITM.

What’s would you do in this situation? Try and claw back some calls now? Just let them expire?

What’s the best tax advantaged move? (US trader middle income)

We don’t need the money for anything right away. I just don’t want my wife to jab me about it for years. 

Thank you.",

Servicenow is around 20% down from its ATH, had a bigger drawdown around April but I missed this opportunity. Right now, it's one of the few tech stocks that are big but not one of the FAANG companies that are not on ATH.

Copart is around 28% down from its ATH, with the lowest stock price since January 2024. The stock is in a very long-term upward trend, it could drop below 200 EMA soon for the first time in ages though soon.

Berkshire is around 12% down from its ATH. It's a stock that you never get cheap, the last time it had such a drawdown was in 2023. Buffett retiring concerns me a bit though, it was inevitable considering his age, but he practically was Berkshire and his departure could take away from the ""myth"" BRK.

What do you think about these three stocks right now?",
