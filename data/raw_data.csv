2025-07-01 07:59:21+00:00,stocks,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Trump Takes Aim at Musk Over EV Subsidies; Tesla Shares Slump - Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump lashed out at Elon Musk on Tuesday, accusing the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX chief executive officer of benefiting excessively from government electric vehicle subsidies. Tesla shares tumbled.

“Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. 

“No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!,” he added.

This comes after Musk slammed the US Senate’s latest version of Trump’s multi-trillion dollar tax bill, warning that the cuts to EV and other clean energy credits would be “incredibly destructive” to the country. Tesla shares slumped 5.8% in European premarket trading on Tradegate.

Tesla has benefitted from a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles that Trump’s bill will eliminate. The automaker is set to release second-quarter sales later this week that will likely show a further slump in demand.

“Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate,” Trump said. “It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign. Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one.”"

Australia’s $6 trillion iron ore discovery will boost supply and likely lower global iron ore prices. 

A new Rio Tinto and China Baowu Joint venture mine will add even more output, keeping Australia the top supplier while China stays the biggest buyer.

Lower iron ore prices mean cheaper steel, which helps US companies like GM and Ford cut vehicle production costs. 

Nucor and US Steel can benefit too, as cheaper raw materials can improve their profit margins and make their steel more competitive. 

Overall, lower iron ore prices can lift earnings for automakers, machinery makers, and steel producers, supporting share prices if other costs stay stable."

Reads: The source of the problem believes he will be the source of the solution.

No more comparing Tesla's brand damage issue to Bud Light. This is the equivalent of putting Mulvaney in charge of subsequent clean up job. The thing that amazes me most, is that Elon is completely unaware that the problem is **him**. He blamed Afshar as if he could have done something more, fired him (and the entire PR departement a while back if you remember), then with his planet sized ego, puts himself in charge of the problem he needlessly created. What does he think he is going to do? Convince all of Europe to see things his way and change their entire culture to suit his whack-a-doodle views? In his mind, are they all going to be doing the elbowless waves to idolize him by the end of Q3?

Simultaneously, he is now trying to take on the entire US government by going after both sides of the aisle. At what point does the market realize Elon has completely lost his mind? He is clearly having some sort of delusions about taking over the world. His cult followers that were the only ones allowed to ride in the staged Robotaxi ""launch"" understood their mission from their leader. Unless you want to hear a 15-minute Tesla pump session, just skip to the 18:00 mark on this video when he gets out:

Transcript: ""*I'm feeling pretty bullish. I think I am going to buy the stock. This company is about to take over the world I think...*""

They aren't even being subtle about it anymore. They are just telling people to buy the stock because a few select social media influencers were given highly controlled rides and a clear mission to pump. It all seems so desperate. Elon purchased Twitter to build his influence and I speculate somewhere around 10% of his 221+ million followers have had their brain turned to mush by Grok. That is a lot of people that can pump this meme stock. And they probably do think Elon will take over the world and will put their last pennies into that fantasy. Does anyone think that a staged social media campaign based on pure nonsense is enough to keep this stock in absurd P/E range that it has held in at for such a long time?

At what point is the board of Tesla liable to the shareholders for allowing this sort of behavior to continue? I guess they are all too busy selling their shares as fast as their agreements allow them to. Seriously, does anyone look at the insider trading activity and recent high-level departures of this company as have any doubts as to what is going on inside this rapidly failing company?

\*I hold TSLZ right now. And I think the collapse of this meme stock is near."

2025-07-01 19:56:22+00:00,stocks,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Will Tesla go down more tomorrow following the vehicle delivery report? - What do we think? Will it go down further tomorrow? I sold today thinking it will and am waiting to buy the dip. I think it'll go down but I've been wrong before.

Here's a summary from the internet: 

Tesla is expected to report a decrease in second-quarter vehicle deliveries, with estimates around 400,000 vehicles, a decline from the 440,000 delivered in the same period last year. This anticipated drop is partially attributed to a political backlash against CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration and his controversial political views. In the first quarter, Tesla delivered 336,681 vehicles, a 13% decrease compared to the same period last year, according to CNBC. Production also saw a decline in the first quarter, with 362,615 vehicles produced globally, which was also below analyst expectations. 

Q2 2025 Projections:
Analysts predict Tesla will deliver approximately 400,000 vehicles in Q2 2025, which is a decrease from the 440,000 delivered in Q2 2024. 

Q1 2025 Results:
In Q1 2025, Tesla delivered 336,681 vehicles, a decrease of 13% compared to the 386,810 delivered in Q1 2024. 

Production:
Tesla produced 362,615 vehicles in Q1 2025, including 345,454 Model 3 and Y, and 17,161 units of other models. 

Factors Affecting Deliveries:
The anticipated decline in Q2 deliveries is influenced by a political backlash against Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration and his political views. 

Other factors:
Changes in Model Y production lines across Gigafactories, and the buildup of inventory, especially in China, also contributed to the first quarter results. 

Future Outlook:
Despite the anticipated drop in Q2, Tesla is still expected to offer lower-cost and autonomous vehicles in 2025, which could lead to future growth.   "

Despite the anticipated drop in Q2, Tesla is still expected to offer lower-cost and autonomous vehicles in 2025, which could lead to future growth.   "

First, the subsidy threat is no longer just political noise. The Senate pushed forward a bill that could kill EV tax credits earlier than expected  that's about $1.2B off Tesla’s bottom line annually. Then Trump goes online and basically threatens to cut all federal funding across Musk’s businesses, including SpaceX

Second, demand in Europe looks weak. Sweden and Denmark just posted a sixth straight month of declining sales. Not great timing, since Q2 global deliveries come out tomorrow. Street is looking for an 11% YoY drop  if it’s worse, this thing probably flushes below $290

Also, I’m starting to think the “Musk distraction” angle is becoming more than just a meme. He’s on X talking politics, posting AI memes, calling out spending bills… while deliveries are slipping. Doesn’t inspire confidence, and the market’s starting to reflect that

Not short yet, not buying either. Waiting to see the delivery number. If it disappoints, I may play short into 270s. If it surprises to the upside, maybe there’s a bounce near 285–290

Anyone else shifting positioning here, or still seeing this as noise? Curious how you're factoring the subsidy risk into valuation now"

A spokesperson for OpenAI told the news agency that OpenAI is in early testing with some of Google's TPUs, but it has no plans to deploy them at scale right now, the report added.

OpenAI is actively using Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, and AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) AI chips to power its growing demand, the report noted.

A potential deal for Google's TPUs could have marked a supplier diversification for OpenAI, which has relied on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips in the past to train its AI models and for inference computing. On Monday, analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a research note that potential usage of Google's chips for inferencing OpenAI's AI workloads would have been a significant endorsement of Google's hardware.

Over the weekend, it was reported that OpenAI has started using Google-made AI chips to build its products. However, it was noted that Google was not providing the most powerful TPUs to OpenAI, signaling its plans to use its most advanced versions to power the company's internal projects, including its own large language model Gemini.

Last month, OpenAI, reportedly, signed a deal with Google Cloud for the AI company's computing needs."

2025-07-02 03:49:35+00:00,stocks,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Big beautiful Bill , Medicare and Medicaid cuts and Healthcare REITs - The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed on July 1, 2025, is the biggest cut to U.S. healthcare funding in years. It reduces Medicaid by $793 billion over 10 years, changes the ACA, trims Medicare, and puts more pressure on hospitals, nursing homes, and senior care, all of which affect healthcare real estate stocks.

With the new cuts and tougher rules, about 7 to 8 million people could lose Medicaid, and up to 17 million total could lose health insurance by 2034. Many will end up in emergency rooms for basic care, raising unpaid hospital bills and hurting local budgets.

Medicare will shrink by about $2 trillion, pushing more seniors into private Medicare Advantage plans that can cost more. Some seniors get a small tax break but will still face higher costs for care.

Nursing homes and assisted living centers will get less money from states. New rules mean they must hire more staff, which costs more. Many may have to downsize or close if they can’t cover these extra costs.

Rural hospitals and safety-net hospitals will see more uninsured patients and more unpaid bills. Some may shut down, putting patients at risk in small towns and poor areas.

This may hurt healthcare real estate companies too. Big healthcare REITs like Welltower (WELL), Ventas (VTR), Healthpeak Properties (PEAK), Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI), Sabra Health Care REIT (SBRA), LTC Properties (LTC), Medical Properties Trust (MPW), Physicians Realty Trust (DOC), Universal Health Realty Income Trust (UHT), and Community Healthcare Trust (CHCT) may get a tax break because the bill raises the real estate pass-through deduction from 20% to 23%. But if hospitals, nursing homes, or senior housing close or lose money, these REITs could have empty buildings or tenants who can’t pay rent. Senior and Adults children ( children of adults) will feel the heat in their pockets. 

In short, this law will cut healthcare for millions and make hospitals and nursing homes struggle, especially in rural areas. The REITs above might save on taxes for now but face risks if their tenants can’t survive the funding cuts. Investors should watch for more closures, lower rent payments, and weaker property values in this sector for years to come.

Expect lot of rebalancing and redirection of flow of fund within healthcare REITs in the next few days."

(3) animus towards UnitedHealth was such that, subsequent to the murder of Mr. Thompson, many Americans openly celebrated his demise, expressed admiration for his accused killer, and/or otherwise demanded that UnitedHealth change its strategy even if they condemned Mr. Thompson's killing;

(4) the foregoing regulatory and public outrage caused UnitedHealth to change its corporate practices; 

(5) notwithstanding the foregoing, UnitedHealth recklessly stuck with the guidance it issued the day before Thompson's murder, which was unrealistic considering the Company's changing corporate strategies; and 

(6) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.

I’ll be honest, I panicked during April and sold all my tech and went to SGOV for safety.

Not embarrassed, just new to the markets.

Then when things started recovering in May, I wanted to go into something that didn’t expose me that much again - learned my lesson.

I did a lot of research and scanned over Reddit for many days and stumbled upon SCHD.

It matched exactly what I wanted- solid stable dividends and good price action since it had S&P 500 ish exposure.

So I brought SCHD late May.

Now I am a little pissed because the markets are back to ATH and I missed the rally.

I read on Twitter/X and ZeroHedge we got a lot more room to run for tech.

So I am going back all into tech now- think the right move now.

I did a lot of research and decided to allocate and go in equal parts META GOOGL and QQQ.

I think this will get me the returns I am looking for during this next leg up.

Am I wrong?  Are you doing something similar?"

I have been reviewing recently the company Nextdoor Holdings Inc, now their balance sheet is terrible.

Could those users be rotating to NextDoor?

As for the chart, it looks very intriguing where we had almost a quad bottom dating back last in September to May this year. We had a gap down early March but before the gap down it looks like from July of last year 2024 to about February/March this year 2025 a cup and handle was established. I feel as though we need to go back up and close that gap it has broken out of its downward wedge if we can regain and establish the levels above where the handle was created, I think long-term we can head to 12 bucks if this company does not get acquired as this is a small cap. Please feel free to call me out and anything that I have missed and what I could do better at in my holistic analysis."

In my area, there was a strong push for people to lease cars instead of buying them. After their lease term ends, they’re not allowed to buy out the cars (though this might change). Additionally, with the possibility of the house passing the bill and removing tax credits on new and used vehicles, isn’t this number going to significantly change by the fourth quarter? Leases will be done, and will people continue to buy or use Teslas now that it will cost 24% more to buyers? I simply don’t understand how Tesla stock is up. This is probably the worst news to happen to Elon Musk.

Furthermore, people who are leasing will lose out on their credit by September 30th, 2025. Since the credit is spread throughout their lease term, I doubt Tesla will honor this if it’s not manipulation. Alternatively, does hedge funds know that the EV credit rule will be redacted, and thus why the stock is up? This is because Goldman Sachs just updated the buy rating for the company from $285 to $315, which seems highly suspicious."

Would love some advice here. I have Schwab and Amex High yield

I also have about 16k in Schwab spread out between individual stocks ( I know most advise against this for obvious reasons...) TSLA META AAPL GOOG PLTR AMZN. ( I know... tough picks... but all up.) I have an additional 20k on the sidelines with in my schab account that I'm trying to feel out where to put. I'be been looking at FXAIX as a solid safer/smarter place to put it since it's a larger buy. was considering SWPPX but looks like FXAIX has a slightly better return/expense ratio.
for context I'm 32, no debt."

2025-07-03 17:35:48+00:00,stocks,reddit.com/r/stocks,"MBLY: We Are Watching a Short Squeeze Unfold in Real Time – And Puts Are Getting Obliterated - For market participants closely monitoring the dynamics of heavily shorted equities, Mobileye Global (MBLY) is currently presenting a compelling live case study of a short squeeze in progress. MBLY has long been a **target for short sellers, with approximately 23.6% of its float held in short positions** as of the latest data. This substantial short interest establishes the perfect conditions for a squeeze. As the stock price rises unexpectedly, short sellers, who borrowed shares to sell, are increasingly pressured to buy them back to cover their positions and limit mounting losses. **This forced buying fuels further upward price momentum, creating a positive feedback loop that accelerates the squeeze.** 

Since **April 21, 2025, when MBLY shares traded at $11.58**, the stock has experienced a dramatic ascent, **yesterday, July 2nd, trading at up to $19.38**. This remarkable **67% surge** in just over two months is creating significant pain for short sellers.

What adds a layer of complexity and heightened risk to this MBLY scenario is the behavior of its options market. Despite the aggressive upward price movement in the underlying stock, the implied volatility (IV) in MBLY options has remained notably subdued, often registering in the 25-34th percentile. This suggests that the options market, prior to and even during parts of this rally, has not fully priced in the true extent of the stock's potential for sharp movements.

Further exacerbating this is the general illiquidity prevalent in MBLY's options contracts. In such an environment, large orders can have a disproportionate impact on prices, and it becomes challenging for market participants to enter or exit positions efficiently. Bid-ask spreads can widen, and the ability to find a counterparty quickly is diminished.

This combination of low IV and illiquidity has created a dangerous trap, particularly for naked call sellers. Naked call selling involves writing (selling) call options without owning the underlying shares. While this strategy offers upfront premium income, its risk profile is theoretically unlimited if the stock price rises significantly above the strike price. Traders who sold naked calls on MBLY, potentially misjudging the stock's volatility due to its low IV or underestimating the potential for a short squeeze, are now finding themselves deeply underwater. The rapid surge in MBLY's share price means these calls are now significantly in-the-money, forcing sellers into a desperate situation where they must either buy back the highly appreciated calls or acquire the underlying shares at inflated prices to fulfill their obligations. The illiquid options market makes their exit even more painful and costly.

Moreover, it appears that significant amounts of put options were purchased, likely by investors or traders betting on a decline in MBLY's price. Given the substantial rally, it is highly probable that a considerable portion of these purchased put options are now deep out-of-the-money (OTM) and are set to expire worthless. This represents another cohort of market participants incurring losses, as the premiums paid for these puts will be forfeited. This also contributes to the overall market dynamics, as put sellers (who benefited from the stock's rise) now face no obligation to buy shares at lower strike prices.

While the short squeeze mechanics are undeniable, it's also important to acknowledge broader factors that may be contributing to Mobileye's upward momentum. Easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, hints of potential interest rate cuts by central banks, and positive news regarding strategic partnerships (such as reported collaborations for robotaxi services utilizing Mobileye's technology) are all providing a constructive backdrop for the company.

The ongoing MBLY saga serves as a timely reminder of the potent forces at play in financial markets – particularly the confluence of high short interest, market sentiment, and the often-unforeseen consequences within the options trading landscape.

Im trying to learn as much as possible as I would like to start investing. I have a decent chunk in funds for my age. My main question is if the market crashes do you still own the shares you bought? For example say back in August of 2008 you bought 50 shares of the s&p 500 and then in September it dropped significantly. Do you still own those 50 shares? Meaning can you just wait til it recovers than it will boost your money back up? Or is that not how it works? Oh and does anyone recommend any lower risk stocks to invest in for a beginner? Thanks!

The President Meets His Deadline. - President Donald Trump and Republicans will hit their July 4 deadline to pass the president’s signature tax and spending legislation and sign it into law. Now the pressure will be on to convince voters that Trump’s achievement will make the U.S. economy stronger. Americans thus far aren’t convinced.

The House voted 218-214 to pass the bill, which extends the individual tax cuts that Trump originally signed into law in 2017, among other provisions.

Over the past two days, fiscal conservatives have lambasted the bill for adding a projected $3.4 trillion to the $36.2 trillion national debt over the next decade. Meanwhile, some GOP moderates expressed concern about the bill’s cuts to Medicaid that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said will likely result in nearly 12 million people losing their insurance coverage.

In the end, both groups folded without any changes. Some previous holdouts said the White House made assurances on how they would enforce certain provisions in the bill, while House leadership also suggested Republicans would have a chance to pass another bill to make changes later in the year.

Next week I'll consider two scenarios  If it breaks strongly above $160 by next week, I may make a small call option spread and follow it closely. I don't want to scale up here, but if the disk looks okay, I'll ride the momentum in the short term. If it jumps to the upside and starts to fall sharply, especially if it breaks below VWAP early and can't get back up, I'll probably buy some puts or bear spreads targeting a pullback to the $145 area, where there's been support

I won't lie, this stuff feels frothy. the RSI index is quite stretched and has risen vertically with little to no consolidation. Nonetheless, the AI hype is still very real and a lot of institutional money is still pouring in.

In the second quarter ending June 30, Lucid produced 3,863 vehicles and delivered 3,309. These numbers alone are somewhat disappointing; overproducing 554 vehicles could indicate demand is lagging behind management's expectations. The numbers also mean that Lucid needs to more than double its production in the second half of the year to meet its goal of 20,000 vehicles produced in 2025."

I talked with a pm at altimeter in SF once and he struck me as a simple, naive but nice person.

You would’ve never guessed that this gentlemen has delivered consistent double digit returns that are far above and beyond his peers.

How is this possible?

The more I thought about it, the more I realized this was a common quality among many of the managers I met when I was an analyst at a FoF.

I know the claim is bold, but it maybe has to do with the high IQ mindset to overthink every situation.

What if rates goes up 25bps, how about 50bps?

What if the growth rate expands by 20% because of user uptick?

Have we modeled for the TSMC partnership next quarter?

Maybe I am wrong, but I think there is an inverse relationship between manager IQ and alpha."

The tariffs caused significant market disruption, leading many investors, even experienced ones, to sell off their holdings. This panic was evident across various online forums, including this one.

While a small number of individuals advocated for maintaining steady investment practices and avoiding panic, the overwhelming majority expressed extremely pessimistic views, with some even predicting an economic apocalypse. Many urged investors to pull their money out of the market, claiming this was an unprecedented economic event. There was also a strong push to invest in European and emerging markets instead.

Looking back, these dire predictions proved to be false. Investors who adhered to established investment principles successfully navigated the turbulence, and those who capitalized on the widespread fear by buying during the downturn have since seen substantial returns. The U.S. markets have experienced a significant surge recently, fueled by positive developments in new trade deals.

This period serves as a reminder about the perils of groupthink and the absence of diverse perspectives in online communities. Too often, biases, mob mentality, and political sentiments unduly influence investment decisions. It's important to learn from this experience: actively seek out dissenting opinions and fortify your investment strategy against fear, groupthink, and short-term market events.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

**Winners:**

Millionaires' inheritance beneficiaries: The estate tax exemption rises to $15 million for individuals, $30 million for married couples, and then adjusts with inflation.

State and local tax deduction rises to $40,000 annually for a five-year period, which phases out for earners over $500,000/year.

Seniors get a larger standard deduction.

Tips and Overtime pay are exempt from income taxes.

529 Plan benefits for younger children went up from $10K to $20K in annual withdrawals while widening the definition of “qualified expenses” in K-12 to include non-tuition categories like books, tutoring, standardized testing fees, educational therapies for children with disabilities, and more.  Increasing the ability to pay for private school, along with public school-type expenses.

Certain professional credential fees, like exams and licensing costs, will also now be covered as qualified expenses under 529 Plan funds.

A new tax-advantaged investment vehicle named the Trump Account (basically a Kid IRA), which has to be established before children turn 18 and can’t be tapped until after they turn 18.  However, 529s remain optimal for those looking to save for educational expenses.

Private Equity tax breaks.

Domestic Car Buyers would get up to $10,000 a year in loan interest deduction through 2028.

Fossil Fuel Producers get tax breaks.

Telecommunications get a massive, wider radio spectrum, increasing service capabilities

**Losers:**

New work requirements for Medicaid recipients with cuts and increased cost sharing.

Expanded work requirements for food stamps to cover beneficiaries up to 65 YO with states to contribute portions of food stamp benefits.

Tax credits for solar panels and wind systems are phasing out.

Tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements are eliminated at the end of the year.

The Senate's decision allows states to continue developing and enforcing their own AI regulations.

EV maker hit by elimination of $7,500 tax credit.

Elite universities get new tiered tax rates as high as 8%.

New 1% tax on transfers of money to foreign countries.  (This is currently tackled by companies such as SoFi with the development of International money transfer utilizing blockchain and Crypto international payment with SoFi/Galileo)

2025-07-04 15:46:28+00:00,stocks,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Carmakers Seek to Offset Tariffs as EU-US Trade Talks Near End - Some European Union carmakers and capitals are pushing for an agreement with President Donald Trump that would allow for tariff relief in return for increasing investments in the US, according to people familiar with the matter.



Member states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.



The EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc’s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.



US and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.



Any deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.



The commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.



The people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they’re prepared to accept in any deal.



Some capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don’t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump’s levies with countermeasures.



The bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.



“We want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. “We will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.”



The EU has approved tariffs on €21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump’s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.



The bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on €95 billion of American products in response to Trump’s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.

As of recent, I bought shares in APH, FIX, and VGK (etf). This was after a bit of research and advice. I went for VGK as it is very very slow but seems to be consistent enough to where im willing to invest a bit in it (also due to a hint of hesitancy in the American market). 

My question arrives as I get older and I feel like im entering the best years of my life to invest. My best stock, far none, has been Costco. Ive continually invested in Cosco from when it was around 180 or so a share. Without a doubt, it has been my best share. Partially due to luck but also research from when I was younger. 

Nevertheless, with an uncertain market in the states, I worry about keeping my portfolio to where it is right now (in which I am in afew industries with VTI and VGK as my two etfs and around 14 individual stocks in a decent arrange of industries). The main being Industrials and health care. In which I would like to expand to a more agricultural side of things and more industrial planning. 

So, I do ask, which stock has been your best far for your portfolio?"

2025-07-05 02:21:41+00:00,stocks,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Planet Labs (PL) will be $50/share soon. Due Diligence - Planet Labs is an AI software and hardware component company for satellites. 

Why the big deal? There is a massive surge in demand on satellites ever since people realized the potential of starlink (starlink has 8000 satellites in orbit alone). Companies and governments are wanting to replicate their own starlink fleets, hence the massive uptick in satellite component manufacturing companies (ASTS/RKLB etc). In the next decade we will see 100s of thousands of satellites being sent to space. 

Company key stats:
- currently trading at $6.80/share (IPO price $10) 
- US company (Silicon valley tech)
- 10% YoY revenue growth 
- 2024 revenue = $244Mn
- Market cap = $2Bn

Major breakthrough last month with a single contract with the German government for $250Mn, literally equaling their 2024 revenue in a single deal. 

Pros:
- relatively unknown company that just surpassed $2Bn MC and has index fund recognition 
- poised in a top growth sector with stable government and big tech contracts
- potential to have the ""rocket labs, RKLB effect"" and turn into a hit stock
- huge incoming demand in services

I truly believe this company and stock will become the next ASTS or RKLB in the coming months. Expect $50/share, which would make it more in line with some of their competitors in terms of revenue vs. Market cap.

Update: the US Navy just gave PL sole award for a major navy contract (undisclosed amount)

2025-07-05 02:39:05+00:00,stocks,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Why ChatGPT / LLMs can never replace stock pickers - ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini are based on LLMs that fundamentally cannot have epistemic knowledge.

Epistemic knowledge refers to knowledge about knowledge.

Great, what does that mean?

In simple terms, that means they don't know what they don't know.

That's why you get hallucinations. It's not a bug, but a piece of its DNA.

Don't believe me?

Ask your favorite LLM.

Can you ever have epistemic knowledge?

Then ask it.

Does that mean you can't ever be a skilled stock picker?

But a future LLM decades into the future must right?

Epistemics has long been argued to be a unique feature of humans just before consciousness.

I'm not sure I am even qualified (or anyone really) to discuss whether epistemics / consciousness can be imbued into something other than a human, let alone a large neural network consisting of binary code.

. . .

That was a fun thought experiment.

Reality?

LLMs may replace some stock pickers (perhaps those with a factor bias), but really will only complement a skilled investor (it is the role of the pm to understand the LLMs limitations though).

As any skilled stock investor will tell you, epistemics is not what drives alpha completely - capital allocation, macro framing, risk mgmt, and ability to identify pre-consensus narratives are all important."

2025-07-05 17:02:40+00:00,stocks,reddit.com/r/stocks,"Waymo's moat is overrated. AVs will become a commodity not a winner take all - There’s a popular view that Waymo will dominate AVs like Google did with search. But that oversimplifies how transport, hardware, and regulation actually work. AVs likely won’t be winner-take-all. More likely, autonomy becomes a commodity layer like smartphone OS or GPS chips where value shifts to branding, logistics, and vertical integration.

Even if Waymo has the best tech, that doesn’t guarantee market control. Car makers can build or license AV systems. Delivery and ride-share players  may care more about cost and scale than whose software is inside.

Once the tech stabilizes, margins shrink and the real competition moves up the stack. What do you think is the market overrating Waymo’s moat? Or is AV dominance still on the table?"

Honestly, kind of a wild setup

RIO been hit by this, obviously, since they ship a ton of aluminum to the US. But if the Canadian gov actually steps in with some kind of aid or subsidy, this might end up being a pretty decent dip buy. Either that or the tariffs get walked back after the election  both scenarios could help

Canada is one of the world's largest aluminum exporters, last year exported about 3.2 million tons to the United States, accounting for more than 50% of total U.S. aluminum imports, the position is very important The U.S. 50% high tariffs on the Canadian aluminum companies cash flow and profits have caused significant pressure , RIO's recent stock price in the $63-65 area has been supported several times to form a clear bottom area, several times the dip was caught by the buyers, suggesting that there is a potential for a stage layout here Overall, the short-term tariff shock brings volatility and risk, but combined with a possible bailout from the Canadian government and the long-term fundamentals of the aluminum industry, there is potential for a staged play here"

When liberation day came, I panicked and sold off everything. I would’ve held had I been in standard Index funds, but my risky positions scared me as I didn’t know if these speculative plays would ever come back. Now here I am, down 15% YTD and depressed. Lots of lessons learned. 

Moving on from this I want to get back to the typical boglehead portfolio, while keeping maybe 5-10% for individual plays. However, I’m afraid about entering now at ATHs. How do you recommend I get back in to the market. Should I DCA, lump sum, or wait it out a few months? My retirement age is still 30+ years away thankfully. "

2025-07-05 23:35:18+00:00,stocks,reddit.com/r/stocks,"sbet ETH Treasury Stock - Recently with crypto gaining momentum. Crypto treasury stocks such as mstr have been top performers. I believe sbet will join this list of top performing crypto treasury companies.

The difference being that it holds eth. Sbet (SharpLink Gaming) main objective is to get you as much eth per share as possible. When the strategy for acquiring eth was announced the price immediately went from single digits to over 100 dollars per share, and preceded to collapse based on misunderstanding in s3 filing.

Context:

SBET announced a $425 million private placement on May 27, 2025, selling \~69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to prominent crypto investors, including Consensys, Pantera Capital, and Galaxy Digital. The proceeds were used to acquire 176,270.69 ETH at an average price of $2,626, valued at \~$462.9 million, positioning SBET as the largest publicly traded Ethereum holder.

Heres my top 8 reasons for v shaped recovery on the ticker back to new highs:

* Misunderstood S-3 Filing and V-Shaped Recovery: The 73% stock crash on June 12, 2025, was due to a misinterpreted S-3 filing mistaken for immediate share dumping, but Joseph Lubin clarified it’s routine, setting SBET up for a quick rebound as seen in its rise to $13.2 by July 3.
* Massive Ethereum Treasury: SBET’s 198,167 ETH (\~$528.8 million) makes it a strong Ethereum investment, with potential for big gains if ETH price appreciates.
* Strong Crypto Backing: Led by Ethereum’s Joseph Lubin (co founder of eth) and backed by Consensys and Pantera Capital, SBET has credible support driving investor interest.
* Nasdaq Compliance and Resilience: SBET regained Nasdaq compliance, reducing risks, and oversold signals suggest a potential 52% price jump soon.
* Staking and creative ways to finance eth purchases: Staking yield is one wise strategy for generating more eth per share. Others include selling common stock when stock price is elevated, issuing convertible notes, and def operations for lending or liquidity pools, creating higher yields than holding ETH alone.
* Round 50% (estimate from coin gecko report) of all stable coins lives on Eth with stable coins growth projected to 10x in the next 5 years. Look at circle and genius act. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent supported this act, and adoption of stable coins. This can be the next catalyst that drives eth price appreciation. (NFTs were major driver for eth in 2021 and has since faded but stable coin adoption is institutional which makes it lot more stable)
* Institutional adoption of stable coins will spark institutional acquisition of eth to help it stabilize the network.
* Clean financials. The company has no debt "

No more global trade currency. - The Big Beautiful Bill will make the US a riskier investment for foreign governments holding assets traded with dollars, this increases our risk of no longer being the reserve currency of the world and has the potential to cause fallout if we don't have an economic boom to justify spending.

  
The US credit rating was downgraded to Aa1 by Moody's in 2023 citing inability to control debt and interest payments, aswell as the potential for the 2017 TCJA tax cuts extentions to add more deficit to debt. Other credit rating agencies have been downgrading the US aswell since 2011.

With the permanent installation of the TCJA tax cuts into law and the many other deficit adding line items in the BBB, doesn't this point to the US becoming riskier and increase our chance we stop being the world trade reserve currency? We lose our ability to out inflate our debt and our deficit problem becomes a deficit crisis if foreign governments dont want to hold devaluing currency due to needing to enact Quantitative Easing when we dig ourselves out of recession.

And before you tell me about tax cuts making rich people work harder with more resources, it didnt happen during Regan and i dont foresee it happening here. We needed genuine investment in key areas, not a blanket tax cut for the ultra rich."

Many, including me, initially thought the economy would crash faster after tariffs, but instead a deep slowdown is hitting per some comments on my previous post; therefore, I dare to rethink. 

Possible  that real unemployment numbers are worse than what appears on the surface. Oil prices were expected to significantly soar during the short US/Israel vs Iran conflict, but they spiked far lower than anyone thought for now, may be to test some resistance and to adjust to the recent Opec cartel production boost. Tesla was expected to crash, holding and dancing for now with better than expected Q2 sales in light of brand damage, but brand damage is incurable, and it seems that Elon no longer care. He is creating a party. So we will eventually get there, Tesla back to the low $100, but when? Robotaxi sales are not going to be spectacular 

The “big beautiful bill” passed easily, but maybe that was always a sure thing. The real story here is “nothing surprising,”  for the market for now. It was priced in at some like to say. The stock market is led by the “Magnificent 7” only on surface and positively impact market beta. Will AI efficiency fill the void of expected job losses and citizen income erosion?

We’re at a turning point: geopolitics and its great games are shedding light on new priorities , AI progress is exponentially disruptive, democratic institutions are eroding and tech billionaire are trying to rewrite the rules, buying lieutenant colonel titles:  Palantir, an obscure company, and I wish I know what they do exactly.

The real economy still decides what happens in the end.

There’s no reliable seasonality pattern for now: stocks don’t always follow predictable patterns. but the index does go up and it does go down..most think that it is 1989 or 2008..real question is when?

The tax breaks from the “big beautiful bill” will help billionaires  to buy more ownership , but if the dollar is decreasing, how to benefit from that or which countries will lose the most and which one will gain the most?

I have no money left to buy any dips if I want, and no balls left to short the market when needed. I am in torpor, mouth wide open..
Someone replied: what is this ? a rant, an opinion or topic to discuss? Well it is all of that, because we are living in crazy times."

Oil prices were expected to significantly soar during the short US/Israel vs Iran conflict, but they spiked far lower than anyone thought for now, may be to test some resistance and to adjust to the recent Opec cartel production boost. Tesla was expected to crash, holding and dancing for now with better than expected Q2 sales in light of brand damage, but brand damage is incurable, and it seems that Elon no longer care. He is creating a party. So we will eventually get there, Tesla back to the low $100, but when? Robotaxi sales are not going to be spectacular 

The “big beautiful bill” passed easily, but maybe that was always a sure thing. The real story here is “nothing surprising,”  for the market for now. It was priced in at some like to say. The stock market is led by the “Magnificent 7” only on surface and positively impact market beta. Will AI efficiency fill the void of expected job losses and citizen income erosion?

We’re at a turning point: geopolitics and its great games are shedding light on new priorities , AI progress is exponentially disruptive, democratic institutions are eroding and tech billionaire are trying to rewrite the rules, buying lieutenant colonel titles:  Palantir, an obscure company, and I wish I know what they do exactly.

The real economy still decides what happens in the end.

There’s no reliable seasonality pattern for now: stocks don’t always follow predictable patterns. but the index does go up and it does go down..most think that it is 1989 or 2008..real question is when?

The tax breaks from the “big beautiful bill” will help billionaires  to buy more ownership , but if the dollar is decreasing, how to benefit from that or which countries will lose the most and which one will gain the most?

I have no money left to buy any dips if I want, and no balls left to short the market when needed. I am in torpor, mouth wide open..

1. Tariff pressure for the next month from trump starting Tuesday 7/8. Honestly, I thought this wouldn't affect Amazon earlier because consumers would just eat the costs.
2. Bezos sold a bunch of stock again


I bought Amazon last year so I am wondering if Amazon will drop below 200 again. Maybe i should just buy the dip?"

Azoria Partners delayed its Azoria Tesla Convexity ETF launch, set for next week, after Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced forming the America Party. Musk shared the news on X, aiming to “give you back your freedom.” The ETF would invest in Tesla’s stocks and options.

Azoria CEO James Fishback criticized Musk’s party on X, reaffirmed support for President Trump, and postponed the ETF. Fishback urged Azoria’s Board to review Musk’s political plans against his Tesla CEO duties, citing reduced shareholder confidence after Musk’s May exit from leading DOGE."

1. Alphabet, 9k, Q1 2023, undervalued…
2. AMD, 7k, Q4 2024, will play out nicely in next years to come I believe. 
3. ASML, 4.7k, Q4 2024, wide moat 
4. First solar, 2.1k, Q4 2024, fears about IRA tax credits being at risk always seemed wrong to me… do think it’s very undervalued and has good growth prospects. not necessarily a big conviction play for me, but somehow have built a large position…. Actually didn’t realise this was my fifth largest hold until posting this…!
5. Pfizer, 2.1k, Q2 2023 (and been averaging down ever since). Long term hold because of potential pipeline and divvy 

Other than Pfizer I’m up on all these positions. "
