Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-07-04 00:20:45+00:00,AAPL,0.1499999999999999,Long,1d,"Carmakers Seek to Offset Tariffs as EU-US Trade Talks Near End - Some European Union carmakers and capitals are pushing for an agreement with President Donald Trump that would allow for tariff relief in return for increasing investments in the US, according to people familiar with the matter.



Member states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.



The EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc’s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.



US and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.



Any deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.



The commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.



The people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they’re prepared to accept in any deal.



Some capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don’t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump’s levies with countermeasures.



The bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.



“We want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. “We will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.”



The EU has approved tariffs on €21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump’s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.



The bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on €95 billion of American products in response to Trump’s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.

2025-07-04 04:06:44+00:00,AAPL,-0.04,Neutral,1d,"Carmakers Seek to Offset Tariffs as EU-US Trade Talks Near End - Some European Union carmakers and capitals are pushing for an agreement with President Donald Trump that would allow for tariff relief in return for increasing investments in the US, according to people familiar with the matter.



Member states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.



The EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc’s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.



US and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.



Any deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.



The commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.



The people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they’re prepared to accept in any deal.



Some capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don’t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump’s levies with countermeasures.



The bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.



“We want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. “We will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.”



The EU has approved tariffs on €21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump’s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.



The bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on €95 billion of American products in response to Trump’s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Member states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.



The EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc’s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.



US and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.



Any deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.



The commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.



The people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they’re prepared to accept in any deal.



Some capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don’t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump’s levies with countermeasures.



The bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.



“We want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. “We will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.”



The EU has approved tariffs on €21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump’s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.



The bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on €95 billion of American products in response to Trump’s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Some capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don’t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump’s levies with countermeasures.



The bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.



“We want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. “We will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.”



The EU has approved tariffs on €21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump’s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.



The bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on €95 billion of American products in response to Trump’s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Member states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.



The EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc’s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.



US and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.



Any deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.

2025-07-04 22:51:19+00:00,AAPL,-0.1,Short,1d,"suggest a book to learn to analyze and pick stocks, that is relevant to current times. - Hello, I am trying to learn how to analyze companies and pick stocks. So far I read 1-2 books that are easy to read and understand for me. There are many famous books that are treated as  bible for stock market investing - like intelligent investor, one up on Wall Street, common stocks uncommon profits etc. I am not trying to learn trading.

I attempted to read ""intelligent investor"" but it was too difficult for me comprehend and it is huge book. I am thinking of reading  ""common stocks uncommon profits"" next.

Since this book was written decades ago - is it a good use of time if my goal is to learn to select stocks to buy ?

At the time these books were written several of the current big companies were in their early stages. I do not think it is possible to find another apple or Walmart now because most likely they will get acquired by the big ones, there is almost a monopoly in some sectors, some companies like google, amazon are in multiple sectors.

Could someone suggest me a book that more relevant to current times that explains what different terms mean, how to use them to pick stocks, how to evaluate companies etc and something less dense that ""intelligent investor"" and more than ""what is a stock"".

Thank you very much for your time.","The sentiment score of -0.10 is appropriate because the text expresses a mix of frustration with complex investment books like ""Intelligent Investor"" and a desire for more current and practical guidance on stock analysis, indicating a slightly negative sentiment overall."
2025-07-05 02:21:41+00:00,AAPL,-0.075,Neutral,1d,"Planet Labs (PL) will be $50/share soon. Due Diligence - Planet Labs is an AI software and hardware component company for satellites. 

Why the big deal? There is a massive surge in demand on satellites ever since people realized the potential of starlink (starlink has 8000 satellites in orbit alone). Companies and governments are wanting to replicate their own starlink fleets, hence the massive uptick in satellite component manufacturing companies (ASTS/RKLB etc). In the next decade we will see 100s of thousands of satellites being sent to space. 

Company key stats:
- currently trading at $6.80/share (IPO price $10) 
- US company (Silicon valley tech)
- 10% YoY revenue growth 
- 2024 revenue = $244Mn
- Market cap = $2Bn

Major breakthrough last month with a single contract with the German government for $250Mn, literally equaling their 2024 revenue in a single deal. 

Pros:
- relatively unknown company that just surpassed $2Bn MC and has index fund recognition 
- poised in a top growth sector with stable government and big tech contracts
- potential to have the ""rocket labs, RKLB effect"" and turn into a hit stock
- huge incoming demand in services

I truly believe this company and stock will become the next ASTS or RKLB in the coming months. Expect $50/share, which would make it more in line with some of their competitors in terms of revenue vs. Market cap.

Update: the US Navy just gave PL sole award for a major navy contract (undisclosed amount)

2025-07-07 01:26:01+00:00,AAPL,-0.3,Short,1d,"Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally? - Trump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.

The Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.

Letters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.

The timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.

What I think the impact will be: 

Easing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound 

Historically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.

 Possible Dollar Weakness?

If the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump “softening his stance” for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.

My view: 

I think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring “over-expectations”), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.

If the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just “political posturing” without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.

What I'm watching: 

NVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment 

 XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports 

 AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation

2025-07-07 07:33:23+00:00,AAPL,-0.05,Neutral,1d,"Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally? - Trump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.

The Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.

Letters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.

The timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.

What I think the impact will be: 

Easing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound 

Historically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.

 Possible Dollar Weakness?

If the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump “softening his stance” for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.

My view: 

I think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring “over-expectations”), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.

If the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just “political posturing” without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.

What I'm watching: 

NVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment 

 XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports 

 AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation 

Welcome to the discussion: 

Do you think this tariff delay is a material positive? Or is it political maneuvering before the election?

 Is it a “bull trap” waiting for everyone to get cut during earnings season?","The sentiment score of -0.05 is appropriate because the text discusses both positive and negative aspects of the tariff delay, highlighting potential market impacts and risks, resulting in a slightly negative sentiment overall."

This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.

The Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.

Letters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.

The timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.

What I think the impact will be: 

Easing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound 

Historically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.

 Possible Dollar Weakness?

If the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump “softening his stance” for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.

My view: 

I think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring “over-expectations”), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.

If the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just “political posturing” without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.

What I'm watching: 

NVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment 

 XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports 

 AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation

2025-07-08 01:14:54+00:00,AAPL,0.1875,Long,1d,"Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I’ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

Operating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)

2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million

2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million

2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million

2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

Net Profit (since becoming an IPP)

2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million

2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million

2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

Let me know what you think, I’m open to all criticism.

We believe “A Great and Beautiful Act” could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,’ said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. ‘Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.’

Evercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.

Mateen said, ""The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .""

The bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.

Evercore noted, ‘The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.’ ""On the capital expenditure side, “bonus depreciation” on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent “bonus depreciation” in the first year.""

Microsoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.

Evercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.

Additionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.","The sentiment score of 0.19 is appropriate as the text discusses positive financial impacts on software companies like Microsoft and Oracle due to favorable tax changes, increased free cash flow estimates, and higher investment in technology, all of which contribute to a generally optimistic outlook for the companies and the sector."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

U.S. Comex copper futures jumped more than 10% after the announcement.


Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

The Trump administration announced a so-called Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports of the red metal in February. The deadline for the investigation to conclude is in November.

The National Mining Association and the American Critical Minerals Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

We believe “A Great and Beautiful Act” could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,’ said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. ‘Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.’

Evercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.

Mateen said, ""The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ......

Evercore noted, ‘The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.’ ""On the capital expenditure side, “bonus depreciation” on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent “bonus depreciation” in the first year.""

Microsoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.

Evercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

U.S. Comex copper futures jumped more than 10% after the announcement.


Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

The Trump administration announced a so-called Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports of the red metal in February. The deadline for the investigation to conclude is in November.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability.

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

U.S. Comex copper futures jumped more than 10% after the announcement.


Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

The Trump administration announced a so-called Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports of the red metal in February. The deadline for the investigation to conclude is in November.

The National Mining Association and the American Critical Minerals Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer, did not immediately respond to request for comment.

We believe “A Great and Beautiful Act” could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,’ said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. ‘Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.’

Evercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.

Mateen said, ""The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ......

As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent “bonus depreciation” in the first year.""

Microsoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

U.S. Comex copper futures jumped more than 10% after the announcement.


Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

The Trump administration announced a so-called Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports of the red metal in February. The deadline for the investigation to conclude is in November.

The National Mining Association and the American Critical Minerals Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer, did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

U.S. Comex copper futures jumped more than 10% after the announcement.


Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

The Trump administration announced a so-called Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports of the red metal in February. The deadline for the investigation to conclude is in November.

The National Mining Association and the American Critical Minerals Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer, did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

U.S. Comex copper futures jumped more than 10% after the announcement.


Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

The Trump administration announced a so-called Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports of the red metal in February. The deadline for the investigation to conclude is in November.

The National Mining Association and the American Critical Minerals Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

Operating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)

2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million

2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million

2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million

2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

Net Profit (since becoming an IPP)

2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million

2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million

2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

Let me know what you think, I’m open to all criticism.

More likely, autonomy becomes a commodity layer like smartphone OS or GPS chips where value shifts to branding, logistics, and vertical integration.

Even if Waymo has the best tech, that doesn’t guarantee market control. Car makers can build or license AV systems. Delivery and ride-share players  may care more about cost and scale than whose software is inside.

Once the tech stabilizes, margins shrink and the real competition moves up the stack. What do you think is the market overrating Waymo’s moat? Or is AV dominance still on the table?","The sentiment score of 0.25 is appropriate because the text presents a balanced view on the potential dominance of Waymo in the autonomous vehicle market, highlighting factors such as competition, market dynamics, and the evolving nature of technology that could impact Waymo's market position."

The difference being that it holds eth. Sbet (SharpLink Gaming) main objective is to get you as much eth per share as possible. When the strategy for acquiring eth was announced the price immediately went from single digits to over 100 dollars per share, and preceded to collapse based on misunderstanding in s3 filing.

Context:

SBET announced a $425 million private placement on May 27, 2025, selling \~69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to prominent crypto investors, including Consensys, Pantera Capital, and Galaxy Digital. The proceeds were used to acquire 176,270.69 ETH at an average price of $2,626, valued at \~$462.9 million, positioning SBET as the largest publicly traded Ethereum holder.

Heres my top 8 reasons for v shaped recovery on the ticker back to new highs:

* Misunderstood S-3 Filing and V-Shaped Recovery: The 73% stock crash on June 12, 2025, was due to a misinterpreted S-3 filing mistaken for immediate share dumping, but Joseph Lubin clarified it’s routine, setting SBET up for a quick rebound as seen in its rise to $13.2 by July 3.
* Massive Ethereum Treasury: SBET’s 198,167 ETH (\~$528.8 million) makes it a strong Ethereum investment, with potential for big gains if ETH price appreciates.
* Strong Crypto Backing: Led by Ethereum’s Joseph Lubin (co founder of eth) and backed by Consensys and Pantera Capital, SBET has credible support driving investor interest.
* Nasdaq Compliance and Resilience: SBET regained Nasdaq compliance, reducing risks, and oversold signals suggest a potential 52% price jump soon.
* Staking and creative ways to finance eth purchases: Staking yield is one wise strategy for generating more eth per share. Others include selling common stock when stock price is elevated, issuing convertible notes, and def operations for lending or liquidity pools, creating higher yields than holding ETH alone.
* Round 50% (estimate from coin gecko report) of all stable coins lives on Eth with stable coins growth projected to 10x in the next 5 years. Look at circle and genius act. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent supported this act, and adoption of stable coins. This can be the next catalyst that drives eth price appreciation. (NFTs were major driver for eth in 2021 and has since faded but stable coin adoption is institutional which makes it lot more stable)
* Institutional adoption of stable coins will spark institutional acquisition of eth to help it stabilize the network.
* Clean financials. The company has no debt ","The sentiment score of 0.25 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced view of the company SBET, highlighting both positive factors such as its large Ethereum treasury and strong backing, as well as challenges like the misunderstood S-3 filing leading to a stock crash, resulting in a neutral overall sentiment"

No more global trade currency. - The Big Beautiful Bill will make the US a riskier investment for foreign governments holding assets traded with dollars, this increases our risk of no longer being the reserve currency of the world and has the potential to cause fallout if we don't have an economic boom to justify spending.

  
The US credit rating was downgraded to Aa1 by Moody's in 2023 citing inability to control debt and interest payments, aswell as the potential for the 2017 TCJA tax cuts extentions to add more deficit to debt. Other credit rating agencies have been downgrading the US aswell since 2011.

With the permanent installation of the TCJA tax cuts into law and the many other deficit adding line items in the BBB, doesn't this point to the US becoming riskier and increase our chance we stop being the world trade reserve currency? We lose our ability to out inflate our debt and our deficit problem becomes a deficit crisis if foreign governments dont want to hold devaluing currency due to needing to enact Quantitative Easing when we dig ourselves out of recession.

# What is NAPS?

At its core, NAPS is built using StockRanks, a composite score that ranks stocks based on Quality, Value, and Momentum (QVM). You:

* Select the two highest-ranked stocks in each of the ten major sectors
* Equal-weight them in the portfolio
* Hold for one year
* Rebalance annually based on updated rankings

It is fully systematic and intentionally avoids subjective decision-making. No news-based trades, no earnings reactions, no macro predictions.

# A Track Record of Outperformance

NAPS has quietly outperformed many professional fund managers and the FTSE All-Share over the past decade in the UK. Its success comes from combining factor-based investing with sector diversification and sticking to it.

There will be no exceptions to this policy,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social Sunday evening stateside.

Separately, Trump confirmed that the U.S. will start delivering letters on Monday, detailing country-specific tariff rates and any agreements reached with various trading partners. That affirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments over the weekend.

BRICS includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran. The bloc describes itself as “a political and diplomatic coordination forum for countries from the Global South and for coordination in the most diverse areas.”

The Trump administration has said that tariffs announced in April will take effect on Aug. 1, instead of July 9, for countries that have not reached an agreement with the U.S.

2025-07-07 05:32:10+00:00,GOOG,-0.05,Neutral,1d,"Trump’s July Tariff Deadline Likely Pushed to August  How Will It Impact Markets? - The anticipation surrounding President Trump's tariff deadline for July 9 seems to be slipping into August, and potentially even beyond, with the latest updates suggesting a more extended timeline for these trade talks. While the administration has touted finalizing agreements soon, trade talks, especially with major partners like the EU, Japan, and India, still seem unresolved

Deadline Shift: Trump’s team previously set a July 9 deadline, but with continued negotiations and open-ended remarks, the new ""real"" date seems to be August 1. That’s when tariffs are expected to kick in, unless further deals are reached

Trade Deals in the Air: While some agreements with countries like Vietnam and the UK are in the pipeline, much bigger players are still in limbo. How these talks evolve could dictate the next moves in the broader market, particularly for trade-sensitive sectors like tech, manufacturing, and agriculture

Recently, the market's reaction to tariff-related news has been relatively muted. Stocks have been rallying even as uncertainty looms. Could this change be just noise, or is there a deeper market trend taking shape? Despite the tariff chatter, the stock market, especially the U.S. stock market, could continue to gain momentum as traders move past the noise and focus on the fundamentals

From what I see now we’re in the recession phase of the financial cycle, and I know that in recession we’ll usually go for defensive sectors like health or consumer staples, I’ve gathered some tickers from the health sector that are performing better than the rest of the stocks in that sector and put them in my watch list.

Also I did take some of the better tech tickers, in case they still go up I’ll go long on them and maybe hedge by shorting on the tech sector by taking a short on a ETF of the tech sector. (Because tech sector usually performs less in recession).

Also started looking into the aerospace sector/industry which performs pretty good and has higher estimated growth and sales for the future than most of the sectors 

Although we’re still in a situation where the NDQ and SP500 and the whole market is still “warm” inflation is high and key indicators are indicating that we’re going into recession, and also there’s the geopolitical situations and tarrfis..

2025-07-07 05:32:10+00:00,GOOG,-0.05,Neutral,1d,"The TACO trade may doom the stock market - Today when Trump announced the 25% tariffs on Japan and Korea, markets had a relatively muted reaction. Even with the Trump administration stating that they’re raising tariff rates on other 12 countries this week, the S&P 500 didn’t even decline a full percentage point. 

The markets current reaction to Trump revamping his tariff talk pales in comparison to the -7% decline after announcing his Canada and Mexico tariffs and the further -12% drop after liberation day. Financial markets have begun to largely ignore Trump and his tariffs, pricing in the expectation that he will ultimately chicken out. 

Here’s the thing: Trump always chickens out *because* of the markets reaction. Whether it was his first term tariffs in 2018 or his walk back of the liberation day tariffs or his eventual decision not to fire JPOW, he always chickens out because of the stock or bond market. 

When the markets stop caring about Trump’s constantly changing tariffs and assume everything will be all right in the end, that’s a **very bad** thing for America. If the market continues to rally based on bullish sentiment while ignoring the possibility that Trump actually keeps the tariffs this time, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

2025-07-07 20:42:59+00:00,GOOG,-0.0428571428571428,Neutral,1d,"The TACO trade may doom the stock market - Today when Trump announced the 25% tariffs on Japan and Korea, markets had a relatively muted reaction. Even with the Trump administration stating that they’re raising tariff rates on other 12 countries this week, the S&P 500 didn’t even decline a full percentage point. 

The markets current reaction to Trump revamping his tariff talk pales in comparison to the -7% decline after announcing his Canada and Mexico tariffs and the further -12% drop after liberation day. Financial markets have begun to largely ignore Trump and his tariffs, pricing in the expectation that he will ultimately chicken out. 

Here’s the thing: Trump always chickens out *because* of the markets reaction. Whether it was his first term tariffs in 2018 or his walk back of the liberation day tariffs or his eventual decision not to fire JPOW, he always chickens out because of the stock or bond market. 

When the markets stop caring about Trump’s constantly changing tariffs and assume everything will be all right in the end, that’s a **very bad** thing for America. If the market continues to rally based on bullish sentiment while ignoring the possibility that Trump actually keeps the tariffs this time, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. He will move on to destroying something else while the tariffs slowly increase inflation and suppress profits. Then, if earnings start coming in negative and the GDP shrinks, the market could crash again like on April 3rd.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

Would love to hear your thoughts.

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

The President Meets His Deadline. - President Donald Trump and Republicans will hit their July 4 deadline to pass the president’s signature tax and spending legislation and sign it into law. Now the pressure will be on to convince voters that Trump’s achievement will make the U.S. economy stronger. Americans thus far aren’t convinced.

The House voted 218-214 to pass the bill, which extends the individual tax cuts that Trump originally signed into law in 2017, among other provisions.

Over the past two days, fiscal conservatives have lambasted the bill for adding a projected $3.4 trillion to the $36.2 trillion national debt over the next decade. Meanwhile, some GOP moderates expressed concern about the bill’s cuts to Medicaid that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said will likely result in nearly 12 million people losing their insurance coverage.

In the end, both groups folded without any changes. Some previous holdouts said the White House made assurances on how they would enforce certain provisions in the bill, while House leadership also suggested Republicans would have a chance to pass another bill to make changes later in the year.

2025-07-03 19:27:35+00:00,TSLA,0.42,Long,1d,"Trump’s Tax Bill Ekes Through House. The President Meets His Deadline. - President Donald Trump and Republicans will hit their July 4 deadline to pass the president’s signature tax and spending legislation and sign it into law. Now the pressure will be on to convince voters that Trump’s achievement will make the U.S. economy stronger. Americans thus far aren’t convinced.

The House voted 218-214 to pass the bill, which extends the individual tax cuts that Trump originally signed into law in 2017, among other provisions.

Over the past two days, fiscal conservatives have lambasted the bill for adding a projected $3.4 trillion to the $36.2 trillion national debt over the next decade. Meanwhile, some GOP moderates expressed concern about the bill’s cuts to Medicaid that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said will likely result in nearly 12 million people losing their insurance coverage.

In the end, both groups folded without any changes. Some previous holdouts said the White House made assurances on how they would enforce certain provisions in the bill, while House leadership also suggested Republicans would have a chance to pass another bill to make changes later in the year.

Epistemic knowledge refers to knowledge about knowledge.

Great, what does that mean?

In simple terms, that means they don't know what they don't know.

That's why you get hallucinations. It's not a bug, but a piece of its DNA.

Don't believe me?

Ask your favorite LLM.

Can you ever have epistemic knowledge?

Then ask it.

Does that mean you can't ever be a skilled stock picker?

But a future LLM decades into the future must right?

Epistemics has long been argued to be a unique feature of humans just before consciousness.

I'm not sure I am even qualified (or anyone really) to discuss whether epistemics / consciousness can be imbued into something other than a human, let alone a large neural network consisting of binary code.

. . .

That was a fun thought experiment.

Reality?

Epistemic knowledge refers to knowledge about knowledge.

Great, what does that mean?

In simple terms, that means they don't know what they don't know.

That's why you get hallucinations. It's not a bug, but a piece of its DNA.

Don't believe me?

Ask your favorite LLM.

Can you ever have epistemic knowledge?

Then ask it.

Does that mean you can't ever be a skilled stock picker?

But a future LLM decades into the future must right?

Epistemics has long been argued to be a unique feature of humans just before consciousness.

I'm not sure I am even qualified (or anyone really) to discuss whether epistemics / consciousness can be imbued into something other than a human, let alone a large neural network consisting of binary code.

. . .

That was a fun thought experiment.

Reality?

LLMs may replace some stock pickers (perhaps those with a factor bias), but really will only complement a skilled investor (it is the role of the pm to understand the LLMs limitations though).

As any skilled stock investor will tell you, epistemics is not what drives alpha completely - capital allocation, macro framing, risk mgmt, and ability to identify pre-consensus narratives are all important.","The sentiment score of 0.03 is appropriate because the text discusses the limitations of AI models like ChatGPT and LLMs in terms of epistemic knowledge, highlighting the importance of human skills in stock picking and the complementary role of AI in the investment process."

Futures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), the S&P 500 (ES=F), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) all dropped around 0.3%.

Trump had targeted July 9 as a self-imposed deadline, when his ""pause"" on steep April tariffs would go back into effect. Global markets have been bracing for that potential shock, with the US only having reached deals with the UK and Vietnam, as well as a framework toward an agreement with China.

But on Sunday, both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump suggested that while Trump could send out letters this week informing countries of their tariff rates, those duties would not go into effect until Aug. 1.

""President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on Aug. 1 you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,"" Bessent told CNN's ""State of Union.""

AAPL, DDOG, BGM, MDB, TEAM, and OKTA could benefit if progress on trade deals helps stabilize sentiment and supports a rebound in both large-cap tech and mid-cap growth names.

Bessent hinted at several possible deals in the coming days, suggesting the focus this week is clarity with 18 major trading partners before setting duties for the 100-plus other countries that the administration has in its sights for trade taxation. Wall Street is waiting to see how trade talks between the European Union and Canada go, in addition to other key partners.","The sentiment score of -0.24 is appropriate because the text discusses potential market volatility and uncertainty due to President Trump's tariff announcements, which could impact trading partners and create confusion in the markets."

Futures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), the S&P 500 (ES=F), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) all dropped around 0.3%.

Trump had targeted July 9 as a self-imposed deadline, when his ""pause"" on steep April tariffs would go back into effect. Global markets have been bracing for that potential shock, with the US only having reached deals with the UK and Vietnam, as well as a framework toward an agreement with China.

But on Sunday, both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump suggested that while Trump could send out letters this week informing countries of their tariff rates, those duties would not go into effect until Aug. 1.

""President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on Aug. 1 you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,"" Bessent told CNN's ""State of Union.""

AAPL, DDOG, BGM, MDB, TEAM, and OKTA could benefit if progress on trade deals helps stabilize sentiment and supports a rebound in both large-cap tech and mid-cap growth names.

Bessent hinted at several possible deals in the coming days, suggesting the focus this week is clarity with 18 major trading partners before setting duties for the 100-plus other countries that the administration has in its sights for trade taxation. Wall Street is waiting to see how trade talks between the European Union and Canada go, in addition to other key partners.","The sentiment score of -0.29 is appropriate because the text discusses potential market volatility and uncertainty due to President Trump's trade policies, which could impact stock futures negatively."

For instance here:

Has anyone gone through this process and can elaborate on the procedure etc? I find it difficult to understand how I - as a private investor - can simply contact a lawfirm such as the on in the link to take the case for me? They even say at no cost.

That sounds really stupid and impossible to me. Plus with the birth rate is in constant decline, market growth is only going to slow as less consumers enter the market than before.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-07-04 00:20:45+00:00,AAPL,-0.04,Neutral,3d,"Carmakers Seek to Offset Tariffs as EU-US Trade Talks Near End - Some European Union carmakers and capitals are pushing for an agreement with President Donald Trump that would allow for tariff relief in return for increasing investments in the US, according to people familiar with the matter.



Member states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.



The EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc’s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.



US and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.



Any deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.



The commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.



The people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they’re prepared to accept in any deal.



Some capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don’t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump’s levies with countermeasures.



The bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.



“We want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. “We will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.”



The EU has approved tariffs on €21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump’s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.



The bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on €95 billion of American products in response to Trump’s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.

Member states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.



The EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc’s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.



US and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.



Any deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.



The commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.



The people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they’re prepared to accept in any deal.



Some capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don’t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump’s levies with countermeasures.



The bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.



“We want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. “We will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.”



The EU has approved tariffs on €21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump’s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.



The bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on €95 billion of American products in response to Trump’s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Member states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.



The EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc’s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.



US and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.



Any deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.



The commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.



The people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they’re prepared to accept in any deal.



Some capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don’t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump’s levies with countermeasures.



The bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.



“We want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. “We will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.”



The EU has approved tariffs on €21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump’s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.



The bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on €95 billion of American products in response to Trump’s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-07-04 22:51:19+00:00,AAPL,-0.1333333333333333,Short,3d,"Carmakers Seek to Offset Tariffs as EU-US Trade Talks Near End - Some European Union carmakers and capitals are pushing for an agreement with President Donald Trump that would allow for tariff relief in return for increasing investments in the US, according to people familiar with the matter.



Member states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.



The EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc’s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.



US and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.



Any deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.



The commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.



The people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they’re prepared to accept in any deal.



Some capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don’t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump’s levies with countermeasures.



The bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.



“We want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. “We will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.”



The EU has approved tariffs on €21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump’s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.



The bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on €95 billion of American products in response to Trump’s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.

2025-07-07 01:26:01+00:00,AAPL,-0.0636363636363636,Neutral,3d,"Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally? - Trump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.

The Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.

Letters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.

The timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.

What I think the impact will be: 

Easing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound 

Historically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.

 Possible Dollar Weakness?

If the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump “softening his stance” for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.

My view: 

I think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring “over-expectations”), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.

If the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just “political posturing” without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.

What I'm watching: 

NVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment 

 XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports 

 AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation

2025-07-07 13:50:49+00:00,AAPL,0.109090909090909,Long,3d,"Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally? - Trump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.

The Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.

Letters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.

The timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.

What I think the impact will be: 

Easing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound 

Historically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.

 Possible Dollar Weakness?

If the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump “softening his stance” for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.

My view: 

I think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring “over-expectations”), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.

If the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just “political posturing” without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.

What I'm watching: 

NVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment 

 XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports 

 AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation 

Welcome to the discussion: 

Do you think this tariff delay is a material positive? Or is it political maneuvering before the election?

 Is it a “bull trap” waiting for everyone to get cut during earnings season?","The sentiment score of 0.11 is appropriate because the text discusses potential positive impacts of the tariff delay on the stock market, such as easing trade tensions and potential market reactions, while also acknowledging the uncertainty and risks associated with the situation."

NVIDIA, with an average annual return of 39.2%.
Netflix, with an average annual return of 36.5%.
Apple, with an average annual return of 32.0%.
Monster Beverage, with a total 20-year return of 15,439%.

Survival Rate: Historically, only about 20-25% of companies in the S&P 500 remain in the index after 20 years.

Final Takeaway

2025-07-07 21:04:35+00:00,AAPL,0.1818181818181818,Long,3d,"Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally? - Trump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.

The Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.

Letters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.

The timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.

What I think the impact will be: 

Easing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound 

Historically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.

 Possible Dollar Weakness?

If the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump “softening his stance” for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.

My view: 

I think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring “over-expectations”), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.

If the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just “political posturing” without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.

What I'm watching: 

NVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment 

 XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports 

 AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation 

Welcome to the discussion: 

Do you think this tariff delay is a material positive? Or is it political maneuvering before the election?

 Is it a “bull trap” waiting for everyone to get cut during earnings season?","The sentiment score of 0.18 is appropriate because the text discusses potential positive impacts of the tariff delay on the stock market, such as easing trade tensions leading to a rebound in risk appetite and possible dollar weakness, while also acknowledging potential risks and uncertainties, striking a balanced tone overall."

Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines.

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

We believe “A Great and Beautiful Act” could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,’ said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. ‘Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.’

Evercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.

Mateen said, ""The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .""

The bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.

Evercore noted, ‘The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.’ ""On the capital expenditure side, “bonus depreciation” on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent “bonus depreciation” in the first year.""

Microsoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.

Evercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.

Additionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.","The sentiment score of 0.18 is appropriate because the text discusses positive financial impacts on software companies like Microsoft and Oracle due to favorable tax changes, increased free cash flow estimates, and higher investment expectations in the technology sector."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

U.S. Comex copper futures jumped more than 10% after the announcement.


Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

The Trump administration announced a so-called Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports of the red metal in February. The deadline for the investigation to conclude is in November.

The National Mining Association and the American Critical Minerals Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer, did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Evercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.

Mateen said, ""The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .""

The bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.

Evercore noted, ‘The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.’ ""On the capital expenditure side, “bonus depreciation” on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent “bonus depreciation” in the first year.""

Microsoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.

Evercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.

Additionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.","The sentiment score of 0.13 is appropriate as the text discusses positive financial impacts on software companies like Microsoft and Oracle due to favorable tax changes, increased free cash flow estimates, and higher investment in artificial intelligence and technology sectors, all of which contribute to a generally optimistic outlook for these companies."

Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

U.S. Comex copper futures jumped more than 10% after the announcement.


Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

The Trump administration announced a so-called Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports of the red metal in February. The deadline for the investigation to conclude is in November.

The National Mining Association and the American Critical Minerals Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

U.S. Comex copper futures jumped more than 10% after the announcement.


Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

The Trump administration announced a so-called Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports of the red metal in February. The deadline for the investigation to conclude is in November.

Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

We believe “A Great and Beautiful Act” could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,’ said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. ‘Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.’

Evercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.

Mateen said, ""The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .""

The bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.

Evercore noted, ‘The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.’ ""On the capital expenditure side, “bonus depreciation” on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent “bonus depreciation” in the first year.""

Microsoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.

Evercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.

Additionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.","The sentiment score of 0.19 is appropriate as the text discusses positive financial impacts on software companies like Microsoft and Oracle due to favorable tax changes, increased free cash flow estimates, and higher investment in technology, all of which contribute to a generally optimistic outlook for the companies and the sector."

Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

We believe “A Great and Beautiful Act” could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,’ said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. ‘Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.’

Evercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.

Mateen said, ""The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .""

The bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.

Evercore noted, ‘The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.’ ""On the capital expenditure side, “bonus depreciation” on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent “bonus depreciation” in the first year.""

Microsoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.

Evercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.

Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

2025-07-08 22:51:52+00:00,AAPL,0.1857142857142857,Long,3d,"Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I’ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won’t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.

Hallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn’t really that “sexy.” The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.

Merom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it…

Merom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn’t want to be on the end of that queue…

I believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a “moat,” as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power…

Operating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)

2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million

2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million

2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million

2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million

During 2024, Hallador’s then CFO took steps to mothball the company’s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn’t say the same things for their net profit.

Net Profit (since becoming an IPP)

2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million

2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million

2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million

2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million

2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million

After closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.

An energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.

Look, I’m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before… but I believe it’s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company’s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.

Republicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn’t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!

Let me know what you think, I’m open to all criticism.

We believe “A Great and Beautiful Act” could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,’ said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. ‘Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.’

Evercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.

Mateen said, ""The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .""

The bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.

Evercore noted, ‘The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.’ ""On the capital expenditure side, “bonus depreciation” on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent “bonus depreciation” in the first year.""

Microsoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.

Evercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.

Additionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.","The sentiment score of 0.19 is appropriate because the text discusses positive financial impacts on Microsoft and Oracle due to potential increases in free cash flow resulting from favorable tax changes, increased capital expenditures, and overall positive outlook for the technology sector."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump said he will announce a 50% tariff on imported copper on Tuesday, an effort to boost U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many consumer goods.

U.S. Comex copper futures jumped more than 10% after the announcement.


Trump told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting that he planned to make the copper tariff announcement later in the day but he did not say when the tariff would take effect.

The Trump administration announced a so-called Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports of the red metal in February. The deadline for the investigation to conclude is in November.

The National Mining Association and the American Critical Minerals Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer, did not immediately respond to request for comment.

**Winners:**

Millionaires' inheritance beneficiaries: The estate tax exemption rises to $15 million for individuals, $30 million for married couples, and then adjusts with inflation.

State and local tax deduction rises to $40,000 annually for a five-year period, which phases out for earners over $500,000/year.

Seniors get a larger standard deduction.

Tips and Overtime pay are exempt from income taxes.

529 Plan benefits for younger children went up from $10K to $20K in annual withdrawals while widening the definition of “qualified expenses” in K-12 to include non-tuition categories like books, tutoring, standardized testing fees, educational therapies for children with disabilities, and more.  Increasing the ability to pay for private school, along with public school-type expenses.

Certain professional credential fees, like exams and licensing costs, will also now be covered as qualified expenses under 529 Plan funds.

A new tax-advantaged investment vehicle named the Trump Account (basically a Kid IRA), which has to be established before children turn 18 and can’t be tapped until after they turn 18.  However, 529s remain optimal for those looking to save for educational expenses.

Private Equity tax breaks.

Domestic Car Buyers would get up to $10,000 a year in loan interest deduction through 2028.

Fossil Fuel Producers get tax breaks.

Telecommunications get a massive, wider radio spectrum, increasing service capabilities

**Losers:**

New work requirements for Medicaid recipients with cuts and increased cost sharing.

Expanded work requirements for food stamps to cover beneficiaries up to 65 YO with states to contribute portions of food stamp benefits.

Tax credits for solar panels and wind systems are phasing out.

Tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements are eliminated at the end of the year.

The Senate's decision allows states to continue developing and enforcing their own AI regulations.

EV maker hit by elimination of $7,500 tax credit.

Elite universities get new tiered tax rates as high as 8%.

New 1% tax on transfers of money to foreign countries.  (This is currently tackled by companies such as SoFi with the development of International money transfer utilizing blockchain and Crypto international payment with SoFi/Galileo)

Restrictions on some immigrants' access to health coverage premium credits.

Seniors get a larger standard deduction.

Tips and Overtime pay are exempt from income taxes.

529 Plan benefits for younger children went up from $10K to $20K in annual withdrawals while widening the definition of “qualified expenses” in K-12 to include non-tuition categories like books, tutoring, standardized testing fees, educational therapies for children with disabilities, and more.

* Strong Crypto Backing: Led by Ethereum’s Joseph Lubin (co founder of eth) and backed by Consensys and Pantera Capital, SBET has credible support driving investor interest.
* Nasdaq Compliance and Resilience: SBET regained Nasdaq compliance, reducing risks, and oversold signals suggest a potential 52% price jump soon.
* Staking and creative ways to finance eth purchases: Staking yield is one wise strategy for generating more eth per share. Others include selling common stock when stock price is elevated, issuing convertible notes, and def operations for lending or liquidity pools, creating higher yields than holding ETH alone.
* Round 50% (estimate from coin gecko report) of all stable coins lives on Eth with stable coins growth projected to 10x in the next 5 years. Look at circle and genius act. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent supported this act, and adoption of stable coins. This can be the next catalyst that drives eth price appreciation. (NFTs were major driver for eth in 2021 and has since faded but stable coin adoption is institutional which makes it lot more stable)
* Institutional adoption of stable coins will spark institutional acquisition of eth to help it stabilize the network.
* Clean financials. The company has no debt ","The sentiment score of 0.19 is appropriate because the text provides a detailed analysis of SBET's financial position, strategic initiatives, and market potential, highlighting positive factors that support a favorable outlook for the company."

The US credit rating was downgraded to Aa1 by Moody's in 2023 citing inability to control debt and interest payments, aswell as the potential for the 2017 TCJA tax cuts extentions to add more deficit to debt. Other credit rating agencies have been downgrading the US aswell since 2011.

With the permanent installation of the TCJA tax cuts into law and the many other deficit adding line items in the BBB, doesn't this point to the US becoming riskier and increase our chance we stop being the world trade reserve currency? We lose our ability to out inflate our debt and our deficit problem becomes a deficit crisis if foreign governments dont want to hold devaluing currency due to needing to enact Quantitative Easing when we dig ourselves out of recession.

# What is NAPS?

At its core, NAPS is built using StockRanks, a composite score that ranks stocks based on Quality, Value, and Momentum (QVM). You:

* Select the two highest-ranked stocks in each of the ten major sectors
* Equal-weight them in the portfolio
* Hold for one year
* Rebalance annually based on updated rankings

It is fully systematic and intentionally avoids subjective decision-making. No news-based trades, no earnings reactions, no macro predictions.

# A Track Record of Outperformance

NAPS has quietly outperformed many professional fund managers and the FTSE All-Share over the past decade in the UK. Its success comes from combining factor-based investing with sector diversification and sticking to it.

# What If You Ran It in the U.S.?

# What is NAPS?

At its core, NAPS is built using StockRanks, a composite score that ranks stocks based on Quality, Value, and Momentum (QVM). You:

* Select the two highest-ranked stocks in each of the ten major sectors
* Equal-weight them in the portfolio
* Hold for one year
* Rebalance annually based on updated rankings

It is fully systematic and intentionally avoids subjective decision-making. No news-based trades, no earnings reactions, no macro predictions.

# A Track Record of Outperformance

NAPS has quietly outperformed many professional fund managers and the FTSE All-Share over the past decade in the UK. Its success comes from combining factor-based investing with sector diversification and sticking to it.

# What If You Ran It in the U.S.?

From what I see now we’re in the recession phase of the financial cycle, and I know that in recession we’ll usually go for defensive sectors like health or consumer staples, I’ve gathered some tickers from the health sector that are performing better than the rest of the stocks in that sector and put them in my watch list.

Also I did take some of the better tech tickers, in case they still go up I’ll go long on them and maybe hedge by shorting on the tech sector by taking a short on a ETF of the tech sector. (Because tech sector usually performs less in recession).

Also started looking into the aerospace sector/industry which performs pretty good and has higher estimated growth and sales for the future than most of the sectors

Even with the Trump administration stating that they’re raising tariff rates on other 12 countries this week, the S&P 500 didn’t even decline a full percentage point. 

The markets current reaction to Trump revamping his tariff talk pales in comparison to the -7% decline after announcing his Canada and Mexico tariffs and the further -12% drop after liberation day. Financial markets have begun to largely ignore Trump and his tariffs, pricing in the expectation that he will ultimately chicken out. 

Here’s the thing: Trump always chickens out *because* of the markets reaction. Whether it was his first term tariffs in 2018 or his walk back of the liberation day tariffs or his eventual decision not to fire JPOW, he always chickens out because of the stock or bond market. 

When the markets stop caring about Trump’s constantly changing tariffs and assume everything will be all right in the end, that’s a **very bad** thing for America. If the market continues to rally based on bullish sentiment while ignoring the possibility that Trump actually keeps the tariffs this time, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. He will move on to destroying something else while the tariffs slowly increase inflation and suppress profits.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

Is that fair or does that just not work long term?

The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

So from everything I’ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it’s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.

But at the same time, I’ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?

Anyway, here’s my situation.

I’m fully long-term. I don’t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.

But just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.

Is that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?

So far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.

Obviously, I know that’s full luck because I didn’t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4–5%.

I just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I’m looking for experienced opinions on this.

So now I’m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to “luck” meaning:

1.	⁠you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.
2.	⁠the rest of your picks performs average
3.	⁠the bottom 5 picks don’t perform terrible?

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

Just wanted to post my thoughts and open to being proven wrong and learning something. Cheers","The sentiment score of 0.04 is appropriate because the text expresses a slightly negative sentiment towards Apple's growth prospects, highlighting concerns about iPhone sales plateauing, competition in the tech space, and potential challenges with AI features impacting customer preferences."

Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).

For Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U [COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).

[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)

Currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump’s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.

Of course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off. 

For a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time. 

One of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC’s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging. 

With Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE. 

Overall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.

The President Meets His Deadline. - President Donald Trump and Republicans will hit their July 4 deadline to pass the president’s signature tax and spending legislation and sign it into law. Now the pressure will be on to convince voters that Trump’s achievement will make the U.S. economy stronger. Americans thus far aren’t convinced.

The House voted 218-214 to pass the bill, which extends the individual tax cuts that Trump originally signed into law in 2017, among other provisions.

Over the past two days, fiscal conservatives have lambasted the bill for adding a projected $3.4 trillion to the $36.2 trillion national debt over the next decade. Meanwhile, some GOP moderates expressed concern about the bill’s cuts to Medicaid that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said will likely result in nearly 12 million people losing their insurance coverage.

In the end, both groups folded without any changes. Some previous holdouts said the White House made assurances on how they would enforce certain provisions in the bill, while House leadership also suggested Republicans would have a chance to pass another bill to make changes later in the year.

As my portfolio expands into new industries, I really wish to diversify.

As of recent, I bought shares in APH, FIX, and VGK (etf). This was after a bit of research and advice. I went for VGK as it is very very slow but seems to be consistent enough to where im willing to invest a bit in it (also due to a hint of hesitancy in the American market). 

My question arrives as I get older and I feel like im entering the best years of my life to invest. My best stock, far none, has been Costco. Ive continually invested in Cosco from when it was around 180 or so a share. Without a doubt, it has been my best share. Partially due to luck but also research from when I was younger. 

Nevertheless, with an uncertain market in the states, I worry about keeping my portfolio to where it is right now (in which I am in afew industries with VTI and VGK as my two etfs and around 14 individual stocks in a decent arrange of industries).

Epistemic knowledge refers to knowledge about knowledge.

Great, what does that mean?

In simple terms, that means they don't know what they don't know.

That's why you get hallucinations. It's not a bug, but a piece of its DNA.

Don't believe me?

Can you ever have epistemic knowledge?

Then ask it.

Does that mean you can't ever be a skilled stock picker?

But a future LLM decades into the future must right?

Epistemics has long been argued to be a unique feature of humans just before consciousness.

I'm not sure I am even qualified (or anyone really) to discuss whether epistemics / consciousness can be imbued into something other than a human, let alone a large neural network consisting of binary code.

LLMs may replace some stock pickers (perhaps those with a factor bias), but really will only complement a skilled investor (it is the role of the pm to understand the LLMs limitations though).

I thought the software was funky, but looked at their financials and they ain't pretty either.  In the last quarter they had 17 million net income on 240 million revenue.

Would you run mission-critical database engine, which is sold by a company that only earns 17 million a quarter?

How the heck does a company's balance sheet consist of almost entirely goodwill?  I'm assuming software companies have lots of intangible goodwill on their balance sheets, but this seems very high for any sort of company.  If I was an investor in PRGS, I'd almost prefer that the intangibles consisted of Bitcoin instead of goodwill (..
