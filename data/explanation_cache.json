Any thoughts would be welcome! - My general thesis is that on July 9, the Stock Market may crash because that's when the foolishness of Trump's trade tariffs will be made clear when his 90 Day Tariffs end on that day. He will not have anything like a clear plan and will not have any countries willing to sign on with him. At that point, the trade-policy gobbledygook will suddenly evaporate and we will have a much clearer view of the the threats to our economy, these including: inflation, rises in cost of living, unemployment, uncertainty and apprehension about the future, etc.\n\nTrump has been making a lot of money for himself and his friends with suddenly raising and lowering tariffs, but he makes money as much of the country loses money.\n\nAlso, he is cheating, breaking the law as he engages in his tariff manipulation and should be punished in some way.\n\nI'd welcome any thoughts on this.

  "-0.300: Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally? - Trump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.\n\nThe Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.\n\nLetters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.\n\nThe timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.\n\nWhat I think the impact will be: \n\nEasing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound \n\nHistorically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.\n\n Possible Dollar Weakness?\n\nIf the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump \u201csoftening his stance\u201d for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.\n\nMy view: \n\nI think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring \u201cover-expectations\u201d), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.\n\nIf the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just \u201cpolitical posturing\u201d without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.\n\nWhat I'm watching: \n\nNVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment \n\n XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports \n\n AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation \n\nWelcome to the discussion: \n\nDo you think this tariff delay is a material positive?

  "0.150: Carmakers Seek to Offset Tariffs as EU-US Trade Talks Near End - Some European Union carmakers and capitals are pushing for an agreement with President Donald Trump that would allow for tariff relief in return for increasing investments in the US, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\n\nMember states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\n\nThe EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc\u2019s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.\n\n\n\nUS and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nAny deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.\n\n\n\nThe commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.\n\n\n\nThe people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they\u2019re prepared to accept in any deal.\n\n\n\nSome capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don\u2019t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump\u2019s levies with countermeasures.\n\n\n\nThe bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,\u201d Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. \u201cWe will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe EU has approved tariffs on \u20ac21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump\u2019s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.\n\n\n\nThe bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on \u20ac95 billion of American products in response to Trump\u2019s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.\n\n  \nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-04/carmakers-seek-to-offset-tariffs-as-eu-us-trade-talks-near-end?srnd=homepage-americas](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-04/carmakers-seek-to-offset-tariffs-as-eu-us-trade-talks-near-end?srnd=homepage-americas)": "The sentiment score of 0.15 is appropriate because the text discusses ongoing trade negotiations between the EU and the US, highlighting the complexities and uncertainties involved in reaching a trade agreement, which can evoke a slightly positive sentiment as progress is being made despite challenges.",

I do not think it is possible to find another apple or Walmart now because most likely they will get acquired by the big ones, there is almost a monopoly in some sectors, some companies like google, amazon are in multiple sectors.\n\nCould someone suggest me a book that more relevant to current times that explains what different terms mean, how to use them to pick stocks, how to evaluate companies etc and something less dense that \"intelligent investor\" and more than \"what is a stock\".\n\nThank you very much for your time.": "The sentiment score of -0.10 is appropriate because the text expresses a mix of frustration with complex investment books like \"Intelligent Investor\" and a desire for more current and practical guidance on stock analysis, indicating a slightly negative sentiment overall.",

  "0.250: Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn\u2019t say the same things for their net profit.\n\nNet Profit (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million\n\nAfter closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.\n\nAn energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before\u2026 but I believe it\u2019s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House.

The state hasn\u2019t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008.

Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.\n\nMateen said, \"The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .\"\n\nThe bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.\n\nEvercore noted, \u2018The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.\u2019 \"On the capital expenditure side, \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d in the first year.\"\n\nMicrosoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.\n\nEvercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500.

  "0.300: Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn\u2019t say the same things for their net profit.\n\nNet Profit (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million\n\nAfter closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.\n\nAn energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before\u2026 but I believe it\u2019s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company\u2019s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.\n\nRepublicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn\u2019t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!\n\nLet me know what you think, I\u2019m open to all criticism.

  "0.311: Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability.

  "0.309: Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn\u2019t say the same things for their net profit.\n\nNet Profit (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million\n\nAfter closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth.

  "0.330: Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn\u2019t say the same things for their net profit.\n\nNet Profit (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million\n\nAfter closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.\n\nAn energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before\u2026 but I believe it\u2019s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company\u2019s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.\n\nRepublicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn\u2019t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!\n\nLet me know what you think, I\u2019m open to all criticism.

Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.\n\nMateen said, \"The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .\"\n\nThe bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.\n\nEvercore noted, \u2018The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.\u2019 \"On the capital expenditure side, \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d in the first year.\"\n\nMicrosoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.\n\nEvercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500.

  "0.262: Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn\u2019t say the same things for their net profit.\n\nNet Profit (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million\n\nAfter closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.\n\nAn energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before\u2026 but I believe it\u2019s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company\u2019s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.\n\nRepublicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn\u2019t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!\n\nLet me know what you think, I\u2019m open to all criticism.

  "0.262: Evercore: Will boost free cash flow for Microsoft and Oracle - Some software companies, such as Microsoft ( NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Oracle ( NYSE: ORCL ), will benefit from higher free cash flow due to some elements of President Donald Trump's \u2018One Great, Beautiful Act,\u2019 Evercore ISI said.\n\nWe believe \u201cA Great and Beautiful Act\u201d could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,\u2019 said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. \u2018Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.\u2019\n\nEvercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.\n\nMateen said, \"The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .\"\n\nThe bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.\n\nEvercore noted, \u2018The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.\u2019 \"On the capital expenditure side, \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d in the first year.\"\n\nMicrosoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.\n\nEvercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.\n\nAdditionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.": "The sentiment score of 0.26 is appropriate as the text discusses positive financial impacts on software companies like Microsoft and Oracle due to favorable tax changes, increased free cash flow estimates, and higher investment in technology, indicating an overall optimistic outlook for the companies and the sector.",

I believe sbet will join this list of top performing crypto treasury companies.\n\nThe difference being that it holds eth. Sbet (SharpLink Gaming) main objective is to get you as much eth per share as possible. When the strategy for acquiring eth was announced the price immediately went from single digits to over 100 dollars per share, and preceded to collapse based on misunderstanding in s3 filing.\n\nContext:\n\nSBET announced a $425 million private placement on May 27, 2025, selling \\~69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to prominent crypto investors, including Consensys, Pantera Capital, and Galaxy Digital.

When the strategy for acquiring eth was announced the price immediately went from single digits to over 100 dollars per share, and preceded to collapse based on misunderstanding in s3 filing.\n\nContext:\n\nSBET announced a $425 million private placement on May 27, 2025, selling \\~69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to prominent crypto investors, including Consensys, Pantera Capital, and Galaxy Digital.

Others include selling common stock when stock price is elevated, issuing convertible notes, and def operations for lending or liquidity pools, creating higher yields than holding ETH alone.\n* Round 50% (estimate from coin gecko report) of all stable coins lives on Eth with stable coins growth projected to 10x in the next 5 years. Look at circle and genius act. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent supported this act, and adoption of stable coins. This can be the next catalyst that drives eth price appreciation.

I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well.

But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of -0.10 is appropriate because the text presents a mix of positive and negative aspects regarding the investment opportunity in the Copper Fund, reflecting a balanced and nuanced evaluation.",

(I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it\u2019s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.\n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my situation.\n\nI\u2019m fully long-term. I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce.

Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.\n\n- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.\n\nI ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI.

  "-0.050: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of -0.05 is appropriate because the text presents a balanced view of the investment opportunity, discussing both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, indicating a neutral sentiment overall.",

  "0.029: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.03 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced and informative analysis of the investment opportunity, discussing both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, without showing strong positive or negative bias.",

I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

(I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it\u2019s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.\n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my situation.\n\nI\u2019m fully long-term. I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

  "0.050: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.05 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced view on the investment opportunity, highlighting both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, leading to a neutral sentiment overall.",

  "0.091: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.09 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced and informative analysis of the investment opportunity, highlighting both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, leading to a neutral sentiment overall.",

(I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it\u2019s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.\n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my situation.\n\nI\u2019m fully long-term. I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well.

But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

  "0.100: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.10 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced view on the investment opportunity, highlighting both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, indicating a neutral sentiment overall.",

(I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it\u2019s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.\n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my situation.\n\nI\u2019m fully long-term. I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

(I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it\u2019s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.\n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my situation.\n\nI\u2019m fully long-term. I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

  "0.121: I don't see MAG7 level growth for Apple - I have a hard time seeing MAG7 level growth for Apple in the mid to long term. Some of my thoughts:\n\n- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view\n\n- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.\n\n- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.\n\nI ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI.

  "0.121: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.12 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced view on the investment opportunity, highlighting both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, indicating a neutral sentiment overall.",

I think they bailed on this.\n\nI ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI.

  "0.090: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.09 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced and informative analysis of the investment opportunity, highlighting both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, leading to a neutral sentiment overall.",

Global markets have been bracing for that potential shock, with the US only having reached deals with the UK and Vietnam, as well as a framework toward an agreement with China.\n\nBut on Sunday, both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump suggested that while Trump could send out letters this week informing countries of their tariff rates, those duties would not go into effect until Aug. 1.\n\n\"President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on Aug. 1 you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\" Bessent told CNN's \"State of Union.\"\n\nAAPL, DDOG, BGM, MDB, TEAM, and OKTA could benefit if progress on trade deals helps stabilize sentiment and supports a rebound in both large-cap tech and mid-cap growth names.\n\nBessent hinted at several possible deals in the coming days, suggesting the focus this week is clarity with 18 major trading partners before setting duties for the 100-plus other countries that the administration has in its sights for trade taxation.

  "-0.133: Carmakers Seek to Offset Tariffs as EU-US Trade Talks Near End - Some European Union carmakers and capitals are pushing for an agreement with President Donald Trump that would allow for tariff relief in return for increasing investments in the US, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\n\nMember states were briefed on the status of trade negotiations on Friday, following talks in Washington this week and were told that a technical agreement in principle was close, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\n\nThe EU has until July 9 to clinch a trade arrangement with Trump before tariffs on nearly all of the bloc\u2019s exports to the US jump to 50%. The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.\n\n\n\nUS and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nAny deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people.\n\n\n\nThe commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe.\n\n\n\nThe people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they\u2019re prepared to accept in any deal.\n\n\n\nSome capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don\u2019t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump\u2019s levies with countermeasures.\n\n\n\nThe bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,\u201d Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. \u201cWe will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe EU has approved tariffs on \u20ac21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump\u2019s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles.\n\n\n\nThe bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on \u20ac95 billion of American products in response to Trump\u2019s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts.\n\n  \nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-04/carmakers-seek-to-offset-tariffs-as-eu-us-trade-talks-near-end?srnd=homepage-americas](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-04/carmakers-seek-to-offset-tariffs-as-eu-us-trade-talks-near-end?srnd=homepage-americas)": "The sentiment score of -0.13 is appropriate because the text discusses the tense and uncertain nature of trade negotiations between the EU and the US, highlighting the challenges and differing views among member states, which can contribute to a slightly negative sentiment.",

  "-0.064: Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally? - Trump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.\n\nThe Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.\n\nLetters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.\n\nThe timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.\n\nWhat I think the impact will be: \n\nEasing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound \n\nHistorically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.\n\n Possible Dollar Weakness?\n\nIf the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump \u201csoftening his stance\u201d for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.\n\nMy view: \n\nI think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring \u201cover-expectations\u201d), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.\n\nIf the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just \u201cpolitical posturing\u201d without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.\n\nWhat I'm watching: \n\nNVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment \n\n XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports \n\n AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation \n\nWelcome to the discussion: \n\nDo you think this tariff delay is a material positive?

  "0.182: Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid.

  "0.108: Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn\u2019t say the same things for their net profit.\n\nNet Profit (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million\n\nAfter closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.\n\nAn energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before\u2026 but I believe it\u2019s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company\u2019s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.\n\nRepublicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn\u2019t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!\n\nLet me know what you think, I\u2019m open to all criticism.

  "0.207: Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn\u2019t say the same things for their net profit.\n\nNet Profit (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million\n\nAfter closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.\n\nAn energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before\u2026 but I believe it\u2019s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company\u2019s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.\n\nRepublicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn\u2019t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!\n\nLet me know what you think, I\u2019m open to all criticism.

While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn\u2019t say the same things for their net profit.\n\nNet Profit (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million\n\nAfter closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.\n\nAn energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before\u2026 but I believe it\u2019s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company\u2019s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.\n\nRepublicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican. The state hasn\u2019t voted its electoral votes for a Democrat president since 1964, other than for Obama in 2008. The state is the second biggest consumer of coal behind Texas and is the biggest consumer of coal per capita in America due to the state using coal power for approximately 50% of its power needs putting it in third place as the most coal-dependent state for its power!\n\nLet me know what you think, I\u2019m open to all criticism.

  "0.170: Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG) Write Up - Hey all, I\u2019ve been looking into Hallador Energy (NASDAQ: HNRG), which is a coal miner based out of Indiana. Since 2022, they have been pivoting towards becoming a diversified and vertically integrated energy company. While most people won\u2019t invest in coal stocks entirely, I think Hallador is being grossly overlooked.\n\nHallador is the 3rd largest coal miner in Indiana and about the 18th largest in America, so their coal mining business isn\u2019t really that \u201csexy.\u201d The real value I believe, is in their vertical integration strategy which saw them acquire the Merom coal-fired power plant in 2022. They mine the coal, they burn the coal, they sell the power into the grid.\n\nMerom is a 1GW coal-fired power plant that was constructed in the 80s. It was originally owned by Hoosier Energy Cooperative, but they sold it to Hallador for an amazingly discounted price. In fact, no cash or shares were given to Hoosier for the plant! Hoosier was trying to rid itself of dirty energy assets, so it was keen to get rid of it\u2026\n\nMerom is grid connected. It supplies the MISO grid, which operates in 15 states across America, serving approx. 45 million people, so it is a great grid to be feeding into. The 1GW interconnection is an amazing asset to own, as it's currently a real challenge to get an interconnection to the MISO grid. For example, there is already 309 GW of power queued for connection into the MISO grid, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be on the end of that queue\u2026\n\nI believe the grid interconnection as an asset could easily be a \u201cmoat,\u201d as it takes a minimum of 3 years to get into the MISO grid. Realistically, it will take you closer to 5 years. The larger the interconnection, the longer the wait times so a 1GW interconnection during this AI power race is worth its weight in gold. Interconnection to the grid is the new bottleneck for power\u2026\n\nOperating Revenue (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)$243.9 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3)$355.6 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$629.9 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex / unprofitable mines)$399 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$400 million - $440 million\n\nDuring 2024, Hallador\u2019s then CFO took steps to mothball the company\u2019s unprofitable coal mines. The company mothballed the Freelandville and Prosperity underground mines to focus on moving towards profitability. Whilst revenue growth was exploding, they couldn\u2019t say the same things for their net profit.\n\nNet Profit (since becoming an IPP)\n\n2021 (focused purely on coal mining)-$3.8 million\n\n2022 (Acquires Merom in Q3, extra revenue from selling power)$18.1 million\n\n2023 (First full year as an IPP)$44.8 million\n\n2024 (Closes high Opex mines, which caused a once off impairment)-$226.1 million\n\n2025 (Analyst estimates)$40 million - $50 million\n\nAfter closing unprofitable segments of the business and restructuring the company, Hallador has moved towards being profitable and cash flow positive, positioning itself for some big growth. The company has spoken of acquiring retiring or unwanted fossil fuel assets from, in particular, energy cooperatives.\n\nAn energy cooperative is a group of people or businesses who work together to produce or share electricity in a way that is affordable and sustainable. The cooperative is owned by its members, and decisions are made democratically any profits are shared among the members. A portion of energy cooperatives are currently trying to remove fossil fuel assets from their spreadsheets, not because they are unprofitable, but because of emission goals of its member businesses.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not here to debate climate change. I believe in it, and I have never invested in a fossil fuel company before\u2026 but I believe it\u2019s the new flavour for the short term whilst theRepublican Party has a hold of the House, Senate, and the White House. Additionally, the company\u2019s coal mining operations, as well as Merom, are based in Indiana, which is a very safe Republican + Trump state.\n\nRepublicans hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate (over 67% of the available seats), and the Governor is Republican.

  "0.169: What Would a NAPS Portfolio Look Like in the U.S.? - For those unfamiliar, NAPS stands for No-Admin Portfolio System, and it\u2019s a popular UK-based investing strategy developed by Stockopedia. The idea is simple: create a low-maintenance, rules-based stock portfolio designed to beat the market without constant oversight.\n\n# What is NAPS?\n\nAt its core, NAPS is built using StockRanks, a composite score that ranks stocks based on Quality, Value, and Momentum (QVM). You:\n\n* Select the two highest-ranked stocks in each of the ten major sectors\n* Equal-weight them in the portfolio\n* Hold for one year\n* Rebalance annually based on updated rankings\n\nIt is fully systematic and intentionally avoids subjective decision-making. No news-based trades, no earnings reactions, no macro predictions.\n\n# A Track Record of Outperformance\n\nNAPS has quietly outperformed many professional fund managers and the FTSE All-Share over the past decade in the UK. Its success comes from combining factor-based investing with sector diversification and sticking to it.\n\n# What If You Ran It in the U.S.?\n\nThis got me thinking: what would a U.S.-based NAPS portfolio look like if you applied the same rules to the U.S. stock market? Using something like Stockopedia\u2019s U.S. coverage or a similar QVM screening method (like Portfolio123 or Finbox), you could replicate the structure:\n\n* Ten sectors\n* Two top-ranked stocks per sector\n* Rebalance once a year\n* Set it and forget it\n\nThe question is: which 20 stocks would make the list right now?": "The sentiment score of 0.17 is appropriate because the text provides a detailed and informative overview of the NAPS investing strategy, highlighting its success in the UK and exploring the potential application of the strategy in the U.S., which can be seen as neutral and informative.",

  "0.153: The TACO trade may doom the stock market - Today when Trump announced the 25% tariffs on Japan and Korea, markets had a relatively muted reaction.

If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election.

The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.04 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced and informative analysis of the investment opportunity, discussing both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, without showing strong positive or negative bias.",

I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well.

But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

Some of my thoughts:\n\n- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view\n\n- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.\n\n- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.\n\nI ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI.

  "0.053: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.05 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced and informative analysis of the investment opportunity, discussing both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, without expressing overly positive or negative sentiments.",

And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view\n\n- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.\n\n- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.\n\nI ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI.

(I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it\u2019s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.\n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my situation.\n\nI\u2019m fully long-term. I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

(I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it\u2019s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.\n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my situation.\n\nI\u2019m fully long-term. I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

  "0.023: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.02 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced and informative analysis of the investment opportunity, discussing both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, without showing strong positive or negative bias.",

If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.10 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced view on the investment opportunity, highlighting both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, indicating a neutral sentiment overall.",

(I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio.

I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

(I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio.

I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well.

But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view\n\n- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.\n\n- apple car, was this a thing?

Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI.

  "0.086: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.09 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced and informative analysis of the investment opportunity, highlighting both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, leading to a slightly positive sentiment overall.",

  "0.055: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.06 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced view of the investment opportunity, highlighting both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, such as the difficulty in arbitraging the prices and the impact of tariffs on the market.",

I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

(I\u2019m from Dubai and I use IBKR, if that matters.)\n\nSo from everything I\u2019ve read, people usually recommend something like a 70% ETF and 30% individual stock split for a long-term portfolio. I totally get that it\u2019s nearly impossible to consistently pick winning stocks, especially as someone with less than a year of experience.\n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019ve heard that line that says a blindfolded monkey picks better stock than an experienced manager?\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my situation.\n\nI\u2019m fully long-term. I don\u2019t plan to sell or liquidate anything, my goal is to just keep adding money every few months and buy/hold stocks.\n\nBut just yesterday I checked my portfolio analysis and kinda panicked when I saw that 76% of it is individual stocks.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing for a long-term portfolio?\n\nSo far, my performance has been really good (probably because I started buying in March/April when things were down). I have over 30 stocks.. few of them are ETFs.. and two of my individual picks are up 50% and 35% just in the last month.\n\nObviously, I know that\u2019s full luck because I didn\u2019t expect the stock to do that well. But considering my worst-performing holdings are VHT, SCHD, and IXJ and even those are only down around 4\u20135%.\n\nI just feel like building my own little basket of stocks have been much better for me. But I only have 6-7 months of exposure, so I\u2019m looking for experienced opinions on this.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering: Does having a higher % in individual stocks just increase your exposure to \u201cluck\u201d meaning:\n\n1.\t\u2060you have a better chance of doing really well in 1 or 2 of picks.\n2.\t\u2060the rest of your picks performs average\n3.\t\u2060the bottom 5 picks don\u2019t perform terrible?\n\nIs that fair or does that just not work long term?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

  "0.056: I don't see MAG7 level growth for Apple - I have a hard time seeing MAG7 level growth for Apple in the mid to long term. Some of my thoughts:\n\n- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view\n\n- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.\n\n- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.\n\nI ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI.

  "0.056: This Copper Fund Is Super Cheap, Am I missing Something? - Please share your input, I am posting to increase my knowledge and refine my investment.\u00a0\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Copper prices have sent prices for American Copper soaring, which will widen the spread between US copper (COMEX) and European Copper (LME).\n\nFor Canadians or if you can buy on the CAD market there is currently a trade to buy copper at extremely cheap prices through Sprott's Physical Copper Trust (COP.U\u00a0[COP.UN](http://cop.un/)).\n\n[https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-commodity-funds/copper/)\n\nCurrently trading at a 20% discount to NAV. If you look back you can see that a discount to NAV started to form after Trump\u2019s election. I originally thought this happened due to the widening spread between Comex and LME (the funds copper is held in Europe), but I have confirmed the NAV of the fund is actually based on LME prices, which is even better.\n\nOf course there is not an easy way to arb either the LME price or even less so the higher Comex price. The fund was doing a value add shipping copper to the US which I am guessing will have to stop. There is a redemption option, though due to copper's heavy weight it is a tough one for most people to pull off.\u00a0\n\nFor a long term investor buying the funds copper at this severe discount is probably a good move if you want some commodities exposure. For shorter term investors we have to ask if there is any mechanism for the discount to be reduced over time.\u00a0\n\nOne of the major updates is that Sprott is listing the fund to be traded on the NYSE, the process is currently in the SEC\u2019s comment period. Based on Chatgpt (not best source!), seems like approval is very likely (80-90%) by around September. If it is approved it will be the US first physical copper fund which would drive some attention into the fund likely decreasing the NAV discount. It could also bring arbiteurs in, but if tariffs continue to be in place the latter seems challenging.\u00a0\n\nWith Sprotts other funds, all of them are far closer to their Nav, though a lot are also listed in the NYSE.\u00a0\n\nOverall management seems keen to add value, but that is just based on my initial impressions and I am diving into it to see if there are other methods that they will use to bring further value to shareholders.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?": "The sentiment score of 0.06 is appropriate because the text provides a balanced view on the investment opportunity, highlighting both the potential benefits of buying copper at a discount and the challenges associated with the investment, indicating a neutral sentiment overall.",

My best stock, far none, has been Costco. Ive continually invested in Cosco from when it was around 180 or so a share. Without a doubt, it has been my best share.

He invests in companies that look cool to him and I think he found them off Cathie Woods.\n\nNow my question, does anyone here invest in a company because it is what you want to become a reality? One example is ACHR. The air transport services with United, Delta, etc along with airports frankly could be overhauled. I want ACHR to, in words, take flight... but I know that the company has unbelievably difficult road ahead with regulations. So much so that I see the possibility of this company ever making profits around 1%.\n\nI told him it would be like gambling, but he is so sure on it. Does anyone else think about using some of their money for companies that have great ideas, but that might be all they are?": "The sentiment score of -0.15 is appropriate because the text expresses a mix of skepticism and caution towards investing in companies based on personal beliefs and innovative ideas, highlighting the potential risks and challenges involved.",
